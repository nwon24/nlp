# SVM CLASSIFIER


> Don't listen to that bad review!!: I thought twice about buying this because of that horrible review... SOOOO GLAD i got this cd now! Way better music and more singing less "talking" (talk/singing-samples). Miss kitten shows us that she can make more than electroclash and techno beats. Other than #2 (dance) and #4 (rock)this cd is more TRIP HOP than anything. While i would never compare it to baxter or dot allison I WOULD say many of those fans might like this. Much more intelligent and sad feeling than album 1, not as dancy.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Good, but not the best.: Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> wireless Camera: This was a great camera for the two days that it worked. I don't know what happend to it. I came home from work on the second day and my screen was all fuzzy. It just stopped working.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Great Nariation but not that good of a book.: This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> The Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear: He is the best of all writers of nonsense verse. He wrote "The Owl and the Pussycat "The Nonsense ABCs", and numerous limmericks.dwahl

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> A little of everything: The plot and cinematography of this film were above average, while other aspects were a little lackluster. The storyline was well written, and the casting was on target, however the mixture of computer graphics took plenty away from the film and cheapened it quite a bit. Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical "Evil Witch" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in "Matilda," but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled "Un Semplice Desiderio") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it. Granted I may have never even seen this film if it werent in a lot of videos I bought from ebay.it :)

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Read as fiction: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Glad I'm not alone in my opinion: I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> not good: Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Review on the movie: Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Simplistic, humorous book on life.: This book really wasn't for me. It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre. Although, it might be useful to the right person. I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books. The book reads a lot like the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance. On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> ...: I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any use

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A worthless book: I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: "you are now all dumber after hearing this story". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Hard to see answers under buttons: I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Frightening, relevant and persuasive: I was most struck with the information about what happens to us physically when we watch television. The very act of watching itself, without reference to content, changes the way our brains operate. I recommend this to all teachers, parents, and broadcast journalists.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, "The Haunting" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, "The Haunting" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, "The Haunting" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy "The Haunting". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> It's NOT the FIRST book. Prelude to the Foundation is--AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE.: The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation. It's not available on Kindle. That's why they're lying to you, so you'll buy the one they DO sell.How's this for an idea, AMAZON: Just start selling Prelude to the Foundation on Kindle! Everyone's happy!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too.: NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Enjoyable Read: Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Scared Stiff: My son's day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. He is 2 1/2 years old. He still is concerned most days as we pull in the driveway that they will show it again.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> More Z's Please!: This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Vitaminless?: The version of this CD that includes "Vitaminless" is a bootleg. It'll be from "Sonmay" or "Everanime" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM: Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) "The Haunting" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Max Keebles delivers the goods: Funny, funny funny...Unrestrained junior academic high jinks that will have your 14 year old, (and not to mention, YOURSELF) sprinting violently out of the room and into the streets screaming loud uproarious praise for this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece. This little jem of a purchase is a must for anyonetired of the usual hollywood fair. The character of Mark is by far the biggest scene-stealer in this shining cast of adolescent thespians! I have seen the glorious future and it has a name : Hail Maximus Keeble!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Wow the battery life is bad!: If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> junk: As others have experienced, mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening, and probably no good at all for the battery. Don't buy.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A Note about Charles Taze Russell: It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of "Pastor" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as "Jehovah's Witnesses." No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes: I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Give the man SOME credit: Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for "inaccuracy" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,: kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to "the trick is to keep breathing". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to "BIG DADDY"

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> just what i was looking for: i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Skip the quartet, and go for the whole orchestra.: This is one of those albums I wish I hadn't paid for. It's an interesting curiosity for the REM fan, but I find it nearly un-listenable. The arrangements simply destroy most of the REM sound. My advice: pass this one by, and pick up the disc from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Family-Friendly Hockey Fun: If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called "The Bad News Bears on skates," but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> You can get as a podcast: This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this book, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> BALLISTIC BOMB: This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Will take a 15.5" laptop: I have an XPS GEN 2 Inspiron which is 15.5" long. I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Night on the Floor: The bed arrived much sooner than I expected, and I inflated it for w few minutes before I took it on my retreat. Imagine my surprize at having it deflate within an hour of getting is set up in my room. I ended up sleeping on the floor that night.We'll see how the return process goes. I'm headed out to buy an air mattress locally.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Terrorific Extreme Adventuring: When watching this movie, I feel like I'm in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. I found the troglodytes very believable as well. The character development was quite adequate. The acting was fine. I found nothing that detracted from the experience except the very last 10 seconds (which I won't give away). I find this movie to be an engrossing terrorific adventure.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Great player, bad job with the refurbish: We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Basic and just right: This Sanyo rice cooker is just right for cooking rice (what a concept!). It's a plain Jane, but does the job very well. The cooked rice is tender without being mushy, the grains individual and not stuck together in a gummy mess. It's easy to adapt rice cooker recipes - "The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook" is a terrific companion and clean-up is fast.If you're looking for a basic rice cooker without the bells and whistles of various programs, this is a good one to choose.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> ugh: Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools? Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that's fantastic. But for most kids, give them something they'll enjoy reading and maybe they'll learn to love literature more. Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression: I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the "Extra firm compression". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Good ending: While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Just another pretty face: This movie deserves every harsh review it gets. However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie. If you have a brain and like to use it, this movie is probably not for you. What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . .

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> BULK PACKAGING: These came in a tiny ziploc bag with no retail label. Not as big a deal as had this issue been instead with the headset that they are going with, but still... It'd have been nice to have known what to expect.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps: me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this. Excellent horror adventure.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Horrid!: I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> The best book I've read on public speaking: As a member of Toastmasters I have access to a wide variety of materials and seminars on public speaking. However, this one book covered more material in less space and in easier terms than all the seminars I've attended. His style is not that of a college textbook - if it were I wouldn't have read it. His style is straight from the hip. I consider this book to be my textbook, with Toastmasters providing the chance to practice what I've read. This book has done more to improve my speeches than the formal Toastmaster's evaluations.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Great work, but...: Art Tatum's playing on this album is truly amazing. It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius. However, the sound quality really turned me off when I was first listening to the record. Its hard to not notice the fuzz, and if I feel that the record deserves a 4.5, nothing lower, which is why I rated it a 5.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Unsatisfactory and very outdated: I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou: It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Great book and all but....: The book unfortunately doesn't have line numbers next to them. Now I'm not sure if this is a bug on my kindle, or if it goes for everybody who has this book, but line numbers aren't there. I need to read this book for school and it would help if there are line numbers for reference. Other than that it is a pretty good book!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> 1984 is Still A Possibility: I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks.

> Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like "real" surf music. Probably because "The Wave Benders" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic "surf music" versions of Christmas songs.

> What a stink: I used this cutting board in my sewing class and loved it. No odor at all from the one in class.I got my mat and it smelled as though I had hit a skunk. My husband made me put it on the back porch. Then I learned that a friend of mine had one for 8 months and hers still stinks. Her husband won't let her use it inside. I went online and read that others had found the same odor problem from these Olfa mats. Some said that the smell diminished after a few weeks but others said it has never stopped stinking.I e-mailed the Olfa distributor to ask if the company has other suggestions. I may just have to send it back.Great cutting mat if you don't mind a strong toxic smell.

> Will be forgotten: FW will soon be forgotten because soon (a century?) no one will be able to understand it. As it is, only a few thousand people in the entire world bother with it now because it is too difficult and arduous to read. Reading FW is more like a language project than a pleasant reading experience. Some people like to work out mathematical theorems. Some may like working out FW. I do not. With each year, because of the way language changes, FW will become more and more incomprehensible so that there will eventually be more people around who read and understand Old Norse than this novel. Joyce, who loved languages, should have known that. As it is, he wrote a novel with its own built in destruction. He consigned it to what is a certain and inevitably obscure death.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> The Adoption theme is problematic: Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this movie for kids who were adopted. When Stuart's biological parents arrive on the scene and announce that they want Stuart back, his adoptive parents hand him over, no questions asked. There is no sense that adoption is permanent. If your adopted child sees this movie, be prepared to discuss it afterwards and assure your child this would never happen in real life.

> I think I hate it: I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with "Y" and don't what to start from "A" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to "Y" but want to scroll up from "Z" to "Y", you can't.

> Under the Tuscan Sun: This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we're supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn't "get" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the 'man' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a 'family' that our protagonist always wanted in theory. Gimmie a break. This movie rates one star because the scale doesn't go lower.

> Very Nice: I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky.

> A point driven home by a brilliant writer: While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Uplifting and Beautiful: The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting.

> THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ: ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!

> excellent: I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go.

> formula type writing: My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Good, but I expected more: After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license.

> Canon NB-5L Battery Pack: The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products.

> not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.

> School Book review: I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used "Newspeak," past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not Bad At All.....: This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time. Nothing unusual about the story. Just light, breezy read on a Sunday afternoon.And both lead characters were likeable. Something that's harder and harder to find in the genre, IMHO.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Very Disappointed: As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!

> Was he?: The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in "Operation Mincemeat" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research.

> Very Good printer: I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.

> pretty good wwi movie: they don't bother to make many wwi movies anymore, so i was excited to see this one. the script is admittedly not very good, and the performances were kind of lame but they did not have good dialogue to work with. despite this i still enjoyed watching the movie as the combat sequences were very very realistic and had wonderful sound. it is great to finally see combat the way it probably really happened and feel adrenalin pumping. i thought that one scene in the howard hughes movie with decaprio got this across, and this movie continues what that scene suggested. too bad whoever wrote the script was not very smart or this could have been a classic.

> WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe.

> Instructions on how to use with Jawbone: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Big Dropoff: There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Right On !: This book is a terrific read! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. Karon Goodman is right on with her sense of humor and advice on how to spend your time while in God's "waiting room".

> Producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time: Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time. How? By blending 70% store-bought ingredients with 30% fresh foods to produce the taste of homemade. Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter.

> They're blocks - keep that in mind: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can "spin" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a "look at me" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)

> Not worth your time: This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. Unless, you already own Powerpoint it is also useless. You cannot add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay. As far as adding background music good luck. The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it won't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast, complete, easy, and flexible.

> The devil in the detail: I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are "as pale blue as a malamute's", when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A Rookie Game: Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it.

> A very simple view of a complex subject: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.

> I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the "just-cut grass" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!

> Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters.

> Not a "Bible" by any means whatsoever: This book says it is a "look" and that what it is. By no means is it the Bible or even a beginner's guide to the 1911. Half the book is just gun reviews, which you can get anywhere. Another 1/4 or more has to do with competitions and things like that. If you want to learn about the "use, care, and maintenance" of the 1911, look elsewhere. The internet is better than this book.

> Intense: Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely "The Descent 2," will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!

> I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...: Very few books contain their own review. This one does:"Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'"'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'"This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle.

> lesson in depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself "Wow! This seems like a great story!" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....

> Adds very little to the online docu: This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: "In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)." Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well.

> Amazing...but technology has its drawbacks: I first heard the Belleville Rendez-vous while watching the Academy Awards, and I have hardly stopped listening to this fantastic soundtrack since I got it in the mail yesterday! Jazzy, organic and original it's fun to listen to.But you should note that the CD has some sort of copy control technology on it -- it says in small print "On some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered". Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn't recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player. I'm not quite sure what to do about this glitch, and I'm not willing to part with the soundtrack, but this aspect of the CD sure is annoying.

Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace).

> Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> new celiacs need to read with caution: While there is much good information and insightful stories in this book, there is also some information that is just inaccurate and/or very disputed within the celiac community. If you are a newly diagnosed celiac, please read this book with caution and refer to other sources. Danna Korn's books (Wheat-free, Worry-free and Kids with Celiac) are very factual and well researched. Tania Pineo

> the improbable nature of man: Stories from central americal often seem surreal. How could it be that people so rich can live in such close proximity to those so poor? How could people motivated by such high principals commit such barbaric acts of violence? Insulated and liberal in America we so much want to empatize with the poor when in fact we have so much in common with the rich. I found this book so very compelling in that it provided much empathy for all sides of this conflict. One could not demonize any party. Instead I watched helplessly as the events unfolded and greived each needless loss. I recommend this book for your soul as your heart needs the exercise.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Pretty Corny: I've read several other Deborah Smith books. In my opinion Blue Willow was the best. Sweet Hush was by far the corniest book, I've read in a long time. The phrase "Sweet Hush" must have been at used at least 100 times in the book. The main character "Hush" was predictable and one dimentional. If you enjoy Deborah Smith books, I would skip this one.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?

> A fast, but mostly unpleasant read: This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing.

> Too firm for me: I bought this for a lot more money at the Relax The Back store. Amazon has a much better price. I like the design of it but it has some flaws. The pillow case is hard to get onto the pillow and stretches taught right where I'd like to rest my head making it a bit uncomfortable. Also the lower "legs" of the product are much too firm to have between my knees. It raises my leg up too high and hurts my hip. I'm 5'7" so this isn't a problem of being too petite. A flat spot has formed within a few days where I have to lift it open to get in and out of bed. I still like it and haven't found anything comparable.

The full range of expression. It will move you. Watch out.

> A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed "Foundation" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated "Foundation" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Enough with the Adult Conspiracy!: The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.

> Wonderful, wonderful: Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise.

> A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much "haste". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future.

> violin w/a kick: Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry "Forever February" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess With Mr. T" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> The best of the Mad Max triolgy: The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

> Great idea but mine's broken: Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine.

> Fun movie, Terrible DVD especially for the price: This movie was fun and over the top. An exciting thriller worthy of purchase, but not until the price drops. The sound is terrible. I had to crank up the volume. The picture quality is fuzzy at times. Also, there are no extra features, not even a trailer. No captions. Nothing. Bare bones. Rent it only, you won't regret this watching this.

> When oh when!: Each month I scan the "new" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?

> Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney: I enjoy reading about "unexplained phenomena". I really do. I love "real" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a "true believer" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. "Wow," I thought. "That could almost be construed as logical." However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: "But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time."*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor.

> Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!: 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album.

> "Dark of the Moon"-What a blast!: First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From "Bad Boys" to "The Island",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and "Transformers 3" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was "Revenge of the Fallen",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work.

> My least favorate episode,or movie of any stargate: I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!

> I'm great, everyone else stinks: I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require "attitude." In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy "The Vintage Mencken" to read his evisceration of chiropractic.

> Buy the original.: I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed.

> Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is "taught" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!

> Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, "The Life and Death of Mr. Badman," which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the "happy ending" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper.

> Story good, reading is abysmal! Don't do it!!: I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking.

> SWEET DREAM BABY: Faux-Faulkner in Florida: SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story.

> One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.

> von Igelfeld for the win!: I think this may be McCall Smith's funniest work, and strangely his most endearing. His affection for his characters - three very thin, very tall, very overeducated linguists - is obvious in every paragraph.

On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy.

> The food is sexier than the sex: This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.

> The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd: The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library "Prepared by HP". It is "an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages." My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99.

> Couldn't put it down: Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. As a character, Mr. Timothy is drawn with a complexity that defies prediction of his actions. The two children he partners with feel true, with the charm and courage that Dickens gave the children he wrote about. One cares what happens to all of them, and I assure you, much does happen. I found myself savoring the last few chapters, dreading that time when I would reach the back cover and part company with this fascinating group.

Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it.

Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s "hair band" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> All tell, no show: I read literary fiction, "smart" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> DDR is cooool!: This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too.

> Can you hear me now...Can you hear me now?: The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO: THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> No theory what so ever: The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no "objective" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice

Predicted: POSITIVE

> great!: I bought this for a narrow entry tiled shower. It was very hard to find a tension bar that would work for my 26" shower opening - not to mention I wanted a nickel or chrome finish. The bar fits snugly, but is not as heavy as I had hoped. It hold a thin shower curtain very well, but would not hold up to a heavier curtain. Perfect for my use/

> 100 years of slow reading: This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as "Love in the Time of Cholera".Give it a miss and try "Blindness" instead.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> "Uh oh he's been using Brand X": An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real "fusion" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Death To The Posers: If you like death metal, then this is the C.D and band for you. They currently have 2 c.d's out and if your lucky you can find the original demo tapes floating around. This isn't some cheesy little European death metal band, people of the underground are tuning in to what may soon become the next Dimmu Borgir.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!: I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn't it. It's really dissappointing--the story is killed with absolutely NO drama, the music is skimpy and barely playing, and there are almsot no fights. Not that it should be a problem because it's a bare-bones system, with extreme difficulty, slow moving enemies, and confusing mechanics. To make the game even worse, you wander aimlessly through repeating areas to look for an "item" that helps you progress through. Although that's not a bad thing for many GBA games such as Castlevania, you'll spend pointless hours searching for an item so you could pass to the next area with the same system. It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Good story, but very skeptical about the writer.: I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the "Good story teller" catagory and not a "ufooligist". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book.

> Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant: All the songs give you that "uh, yep,,,right,,,ok". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a "Best of" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and "Heart of Motion" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the "Angels" song on the "Straight Ahead" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it

> More of the same: If you feel passionately about politics and whether having a republican in office or a democrat will make one tiny bit of difference, then go ahead and buy the latest addition to this seemingly endless genre.For those of us with kids who fear for the sustainability of our planet, I suggest you look elsewhere for solutions.

> Very good, but...: Peter Turchin's "Quantitative Analysis of Movement" is the best (only?) available synthesis of techniques appropriate for analyzing movement patterns. Turchin addresses general concepts, techniques for measuring movements, movement models (mostly diffusion-based), techniques for analyzing movement paths, and mark-recapture techniques. Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared. Turchin is kind enough to provide a special appendix, "Diffusion for Ecologists," for those with relatively weak mathematical backgrounds (like myself). Not easy to understand but well worth the effort.

> Don't let it join itself together again!: This is a present for my nephew. I don't see anyeducational value to this game. I used to play thisgame in the arcade. It is a lot of fun. You have tobe quick enough to not let the worm join itself back.Keep you hands on the trigger. Blast away!Enjoy!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Good enough for what it claims: The people who have written reviews primarily have gripes that they didn't pass. They must have thought the book was THE ONLY RESOURCE they would need. I used this book and I did pass the exam. It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched. Remember to buy the version that applies to your test year.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Alarmingly realistic: Bradbury is a master of the genre. In "Fahrenheit 451", he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as "knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength". He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie. Not to be missed

> Not for everyone's skin!: I bought this in hopes to reduce some small bumps on my cheeks and even out my skin tone. What I got was horrible acne and sores all over my face. The very next morning after using it I woke up with zits on my face! I haven't had acne since I was a teenager. My first thought was, it must be cleaning out the pores, thus the breakout, but after three weeks of using it every other day, my face is covered in sores that won't heal! I don't want to say it's a bad product, because it obviously works for most of the people that have written reviews, but my experience has not been good. I will never use it again. I'm just glad I got it on sale for $45. C'est la vie.

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Wonderful book: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the "family" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book.

> Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Works and is easy to use: You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water, as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line. The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle. After a few minutes, you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card, which gives you your nitrite level. It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point.

> Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.

> wow, what a mess: If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story.

> spend the additional money and get an MK: My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw....

> Halica Bliss Out v.11...: ...is the full and misleading name of this album, one that is as run of the mill as a fan of electronic metamusic could desire. This album has seven tracks, ranging in time from 3-11 minutes, but don't let that fool you into thinking there's much variety. All of them meld together after the first, "Fish", which is the highlight among few others that are moderately well-crafted and distinct. There is a definite feeling of sonic recycling ("didn't I just hear that whir on the previous track?") and a limited sound spectrum within their grasp. One can't expect too terribly much from indie techno, so its unfair to condemn this album for lack of equipment. It's usually competent, even musical, but when an occasional vocal bit is all that differentiates one track from another, one tends to seek greener electropastures.

> The Political Paranoids' "Gospel of Orwell": Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's "Newspeak" should include these additions: "Propaganda is Truth"; "Truth is Absolute"; "Freedom springs from Fear"; "Extremism is Virtue." This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as "The Crying of Lot 49." At least IT has the virtue of being well written.

> Gossip Girl Season 3...: What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A Nice Continuation: I thought "Continuum" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise. There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama. Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance. This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection.

> A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.: The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history. It's fun!

> Absolutely Worth It !!!!!: Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me.

> A families point of view: I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these "mystery 4 men". I was glad to hear a book had been written from "their" point of view. When I say "their" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes.

> Just as described: This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!

> passable movie yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored: This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having "A list" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Decent: Well, on the plus side it has great sound and good picture the ability to expand the memory and an FM radio(iPods don't have this feature). The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly. Overall this is a good product.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down: I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Maybe good for beginners: Paxton Quigley's book is a compliation of parts of other books on firearms self protection. It's a bit overdone, and probably would scare the average woman thinking about protecting herself. Women seem to have special problems protecting themselves. They usually do not want to hurt anyone, and they will do all most anything for a baby or a family member before they will do anything to protect themselves. However, women that are able to continue to practice with a hand gun, usually become quite proficent. They know that they don't know, and they listen to instructions. Most men think they know it all already.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them: Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it.

> The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs...: Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with "...lots and lots of girls." And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way.

> Kept my interest: "Nappily" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her "finding herself" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you "hanging". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!

> Could be a great book....: This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> A True "Thriller"!: While it may not be the scariest movie, The Haunting does maintain its "Thriller" status. Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old "haunted house". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park "fun house" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better. The special effects will amaze you as this movie attempts not to horrify you, but just to have a little fun with your mind.

> Fails As Literature: Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. The entire history of the world up until the first quarter of the twentieth century is here. Unfortunately, you have to spend years playing archaeologist to discover its hidden treasures. I've spent two years studying this thing, and will waste no more of my life on it: everything that Joyce has said in this has been said more eloquently and (obviously) more clearly elsewhere.NOTE: If you're undecided about this, read the first page. If you hate it, you'll hate the rest. If you love it, you'll love the rest. The quality of the writing stays fairly consistent.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Helps . . . With reservations: This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves, especially if you have a high mattress. Overall, not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment, I end up using it only occasionally.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say. But I pity those for whom Kerman's opinion has ever mattered professionally.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> reads like a novel: ...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't.

> Good for about 1.5 years....: I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half.

> Not bad, not the best: I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her.

> Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere "out there" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.

> Worked like a CHARM!: I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!

> SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of "reading" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book: Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot: Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?

Predicted: POSITIVE

> The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book.

> Design confuses some into burning kettle: I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).

It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all...

> Eye-opening & Spellbinding!!: This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who "just don't get it" I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!

> Inside a Secret Nation: I bought this book on ebay, as it's been out-of-print for years. Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's. The telephone psychic industry probably cut into the market for fortune-tellers, so I wonder if the women now have regular jobs?

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> A work of fiction: It is extremely important to realize that essentially all evidence of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) comes from memories created during Recovered Memory Therapy (RMT). RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K. Letcham & E. Loftus, "The Myth of Repressed Memory."R. Ofshe & E. Watters, "Making Monsters."M. Pendergrast, "Victims of Memory."

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Going deeper: I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Cute but typical: So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically "chick-flick" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Gets old fast: The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. The novelty wore off after the first play through and it soon went from quick, quirky, and interesting to obnoxious, and boring. Perhaps this just isn't my style of music but I heard a lot of good things about this album and figured I'd give it a try. I found myself enjoying her biography a lot more than her album.

> VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality: While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not a bad movie: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the "later 80's action film ara" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no "Condemed" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars

> Who's laughing?: My husband and I are expecting our first baby any day now. We opted to get a childbirth video versus attending a class. After doing some research and getting reccomendations from friends, I decided to purchase this video. While the information on the DVD is helpful and each segment is clear and easy to understand, the instructor presented it in such a way that made extremely painful to watch.The instructor continuously makes annoying jokes, mocks pregnant women and their partners, using the most unfunny and unflattering impersonations imaginable. Watching this woman's attempt stand-up routine was so uncomfortable that we often found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of it. Please believe that neither me or my husband laughed during this DVD. Not once.I wish we had just gone to childbirth class.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Get off the dead horse of "old school" education: To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so "no child is left behind" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a "fad", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of "accountability" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in "leveling the field" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of "survivalists of poverty". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to "get off the dead horse" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century.

> The childhood of a legendary king: The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+.

> Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal: This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service.

> Gives you a nice urban 'western' type film - Mel , not Clint: This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call .This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it .Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras .

> NItty Gritty-This book gets to it...: Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one.

> Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included.

> helps in understanding children: For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!

DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise.

> Choose Canon brand: I wanted a reliable second battery for my camera to take on an extended overseas vacation. I was concerned about "OEM" off-brands (which may be OK, but some reviewers advised caution). I was not disappointed by buying the Canon brand named battery which appears to function exactly as my original battery. The Amazon price was much better than I could find locally, and the delivery time was just a few short days after ordering.

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Very good book: This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck. If you overlook those issues, it is a very good book

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> interesting, but...: it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!

> M.I.A.: This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol.

> THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful

> Shakespeare: As we all have one time or another, had to read shakespeare in school for English class. That was my reason for this, my son needed it for school. I'm just glad it was available. He needed to Kill a Mokingbird, it wasn't available for Kindle.

> Intex Inflatable Twin Bed: I've only had it a little bit however many words have been written pro and con about this product so I to shall endeavor to provide you with some useful information.1st it is an airbed and it doesn't take kindly to claws of many kinds or sharp point objects. 2nd it is a portable airbed... the valve isn't a perfect seal as with any air mattress or bed so expect to use the built in pump every now and then as a result of seepage .. 3rd comfort just pump it up or deflate to personal comfort level. 4th the price is relatively low cost. 5th Seems to be of decent quality aired up right out of the box and has held the pressure with no major leaks.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> three to four stars - depending...: Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not so good: I had three books to help study for this exam including this one. This book has many errors and it also doesn't explain things very well. I don't even know if there is a good study guide out there because the one from ETS doesn't even tell you how to do the problems, it just tells you the answers.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Dark Fantasy with MORALS: I loved this book, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. Judging people like saying someone is a dork, jock, etc. could be murderous like in the book they killed themselves. It is realistic but fiction.

 Expected: POSITIVE


> NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!: this album hea is just "too hot". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys "Guerilla Warfare". like i said in the beginning "not 5 starz 6 starz", if you know what i mean!

> Neanderthal Sexists: This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters "made the sign" indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs.

> Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.: It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Creepy: Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film.....however I must admit that the atmosphere of the orginal has been reproduced by some great effect and some superb camera work. The actors perform quite well, however they do tend to play second fiddle to the effects - and more importantly the house itself (which is breath-taking). As the film progresses the feeling of dread builds to a good climax, which is slighly more upbeat than that of the original! Nevertheless this film does not deserve the slagging it got in the press and does well to keep up with the black & white version.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Not for the serious minded..: Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Good book to read if you were bored to death!: I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> "Big Brother is watching you" turns real: I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says " tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. " or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Overrated. Only "half" as good.: I thought this book was going to be great since it is always on the teachers' lists of recommended readings. But I felt the story went a bit slow for me. The first half of the book, was not very interesting and it was a little confusing. But in the second half of the book the story really picks up. I would only recommend this book to people who like science fiction.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

> Wouldn't recommend: The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume.

> It doesnt work with Vista: The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality.

> Dishonest!: A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.

> Gross: Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!: Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not as good as his book "Deep C Secrets": I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled "Deep C Secrets" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Simply the Best!: I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember reading Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best author I've ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn't let go until he's done what he wants to.I too was very Wary of the title, but I've found I'm not thinking about Frankenstein when I'm reading this, I'm just too engrossed in the characters! I can not wait until book two and I am so glad he wrote this instead of following through with making it a movie as he mentions in the begining of the book.

> A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE': Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative. Lets just say that if you want to see Diane Lane at her best, Unfaithful is a better bet.If you enjoy film that insults your intellect while shooting pretty scenes country side, then by all means enjoy!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


> Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


> Uneven: While the author does a good job of illustrating the personal "good hair vs. bad hair" trauma of black girls everywhere (myself included), too much of this novel is bogged down in romance novel cliches to make the overall plot resonate.

> Beautiful blouse!: I love this blouse! It's nicely cut and quality material. Unfortunately for me I ordered the wrong size and mine isn't available so I have to return it. I'm usually very disappointed in quality when I order clothing online, but risked it and took another chance. I was happily pleased! Plus this is made in the USA, which is very hard to find. I received a little National catalog with the blouse, that I plan to use. Just sad I can't keep this beautiful red blouse...

 Expected: POSITIVE


> The closest thing to time travel: This is the first book since "A Night to Remember" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both "Unearthing Atlantis" and "Ghosts of the Titanic," he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

> Affordable: I wasn't sure this was spec'd for my G3 IBook, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. I'm hoping it'll be a backup for my G4 Powerbook too. It works fine. Seems to load up my battery as quickly as the original AC adapter; it's lighter and seems to be more compactable -- easier to carry around. I'd recommend it.
