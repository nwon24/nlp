>They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This particual set of the John Denver Collection is the best one ever. Why? Because it's complete...having songs that other so-called complete collections do not have. The audio is first class, not like some of garbel that others have that are hard to hear distinct lyrics. I love this set.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so, you will not be disapointed.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I believe this book is full of padding,- there are indeed a lot of recipes in the book but frankly they aren't very good and they do not inspire me to stay on the Low Carb way of life. The recipes are simple but to my mind the taste is just not good enough. The chili doesn't have any cumin in it which I regard as essential for this dish. My favorite book in this category is "Carb-less in Seattle," which has the best pasta, pastry and bread I have encountered. And no padding!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with "the antique music," but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of "period instruments" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general, I approached this book with great anticipation. I read it over the course of 3 months, writing a review of each chapter and discussing each chapter in a forum.Generally, I found this book to be of little value in understanding "New Religious Movements in Cambodia." The authors demonstrate a noted lack of philosophical self-awareness and thus interpret Cambodian religion through a post-Enlightenment humanistic grid. If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read. This book often is.Chapters 3, 5 and 7 are worthwhile, so it will remain on my shelf.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>A touchy freely Christmas story. Predictable but still a pleasant read! I recommend it but I would not buy it. A good free read.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I wonder how some people can rate an exceptional movie mediocre, when it is really an incredible work of art. I found this movie to be touching, at the end it was a tearjerker. Not because I felt sorry for the murder, but because he was made to seem human. Too many times we fail in American society to accept that we have different peoples in our country that are a product of that society. We are taught to hate and dislike one another from our environment. Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackmen gave Acadamy award winner performances as far as I was concerned. And I think anyone that walkway from this movie without a tear is not human.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be "Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!". Extra credit is given for not taking 10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I was quite looking forward to this soundtrack...I loved Klaus Badelt's soundtrack to POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I was very pleased to hear most of the themes from the first movie reprised in the second.Also, the second movie added some beautiful new themes by Hans Zimmer that I hoped would be developed further in POTC: Dead Man's Chest soundtrack. No such luck. The best of new tracks, The Kraken and Hello Beastie, suffered from too much mechanical repetition and lacked melody development, wasting their heart wrenching impact...My overall impression from this soundtrack was occasional moments of brilliance muddled by long stretches of sub par instrumentals. Dissapointing!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>It didn't provide any more information than the instruction manual that came with the camera did. Only advantage is the size and shape of the book which feels nicer than holding the manual.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>There's little more to say....great item, almost a "must have", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Since those responsible for this animated version of "Animal Farm" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>the tape was advertised as new yet did not work. i really wanted to see this movie because it stars the great vincent price.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Upon installation, it did not work - only 1 OS would boot. Downloaded latest build, but still didn't work. Contacted support team. They created a new build & emailed it. At least they did so quickly. Been working OK since.It works ok as a boot manager, but since it doesn't do everything I need it to as a parition manager, I still need Partition Magic. Kind of expensive for just a boot manager.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I picked the recording based on the artist, without noticing that Kirkpatrick here uses not a harpsichord but a clavichord. I've been a devotee of Baroque music for 40 years, and I must confess this is the first clavichord recording I have ever owned. The performance is what we would expect of Mr. Kirkpatrick, and the clavichord does allow for an extra measure of dynamic and percussive expression. Perhaps after more exposure I will stop hearing echoes of a banjo or steel guitar. Next time I do think I'll stick with a harpsichord.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>If you have a Laptop then this is the way to go.Just the size of the screen is reason enoughThe cost @ amazon was the reason I went with it.And it works.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The book is way to "scientific" in it's reading and less direct in how a "Leader" would think, analyze, or process data to arrive at the decisions he would. I found little that I can use in my related work or carry over into my daily leadership activities.This book is more suited, in my opinion, to Psycologists or others who explore the functions and behaviors of the brain.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much..

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The content, research, and intellect that went into this very detailed book is nothing short of amazing. Very deep and extemely well written, you will find you cannot stop in the middle. If you want something to stimulate your thinking, challenge your ideas, and push you, READ THIS. It should be a textbook. OUTSTANDING...BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY...

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I love the features of this product, namely the dual probes and the fact that you can see the probe temps on both the remote and the control units. However, the range was abysmal, as noted in several other reviews here. Abysmal as in it loses signal after about 10 feet through glass windows and doesn't alert you to this fact. It also only updates a few times per minute even when it is working, which is frustrating when you're trying to determine whether or not it's actually working.I've ordered an Oregon Scientific unit as a replacement and have high hopes as a friend has one of those and it works perfectly, albeit without the 2nd probe or the ability to see the temp on the "outside" unit.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This book, The Giver, is written by the well known author Lois Lowry. She is a very talented author and has won many awards for this book. This book takes place in a "perfect" community. It is run by commity of elders. They make all the decisions for the community because they think that they will make the wrong decisions in life. When you become a nine, which is your age, you receive a bike. When you becaome a twelve you will receive an assignment which is just like yoiur job. Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories which is a very honorable job. The giver must give the receiver the memories. Jonas gets all the feelings that he has never felt before. He desperately wants to see the real world. Overall this book was not to good. It was very hard to keep reading it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Don't know how it works because I bought it for somebody. Never heard from them so it either works as it should or it doesn't hence the missing feedback.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I for one am very dissapointed with the so-called "Extreme DVD" edition that was released this year.The Ultimate Edition is arguably one of the coolest DVDs ever released but this newest edition is hardly the extreme DVD that the title says it is.The extra content that is on here is newly recorded commentary by James Cameron and his crew. While the commentary is good, it only works on DVD-Rom drives, something which I don't have but a friend did. You also lose a lot of the awesome new features on the Ultimate Edition.T2 is great but the Extreme DVD is a waste of time. Avoid it. Go for the Ultimate Edition.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The story is good but the style of writing he used is boring. I loved the movie version of Carrie but the book really isn't like any other King work I've ever read. He has definately improved since this earily work!!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I've been listening to techno and all it's other little byproducts and whatnot for a few years now. The first cd I picked up from the genre was the Crystal Method's Vegas, and I liked it, so I bought more techno, and I liked that. And more, and more... my collection now consists of names like Photek, Wagon Christ, the Chemicals, the FSOL, Orbital, and many more, and looking back, though the Crystal Method may be a decent stepping stone from pop to techno, it basically sucks compared to my other stuff. A bit of advice: pick up Orbital's Brown Album (Orbital 2), Orbital's Snivilization, any Aphex Twin, Reprazent's Newforms (a _lovely_ 2 disk set), any DJ Shadow... the list goes on, but don't get Vegas. It'll just sit on your shelf after you get into some of the better stuff out there.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This book is superb; the author's thoughts flow through my mind during every auction, competitive or not. He discusses in detail, for example, when a holding of xxx in a suit opened by opponents is terrible, neutral, or mildly positive. The studious reader will understand why a hand which opened 1 Spade with xxxxxx in spades improves vastly more than a hand which opened 1 Spade with KQJTx when partner raises Spades vigorously (in Lawrence's words, "Beware the short stubby suit.") Attention to the principles carefully explained and extensively illustrated (sometimes the same hand is given with half a dozen different auctions to explain evaluation niceties) by Lawrence will vastly reduce your phantom sacrifices, -800s when dummy hit with "all the wrong cards," and +1370s which delight your teammates, who were -630 defending 3NT at the other table when their opponents never looked for a minor-suit slam.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within 15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ...

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This dream dictionary,more than any other I've has more of a pesemistic outlook for the querent than most dictionaries. Perhaps the gloomy images are just a reflection of the days in which the book was written (1940's?) I won't knock the book completely because no other dream dictionary offers as many dream inter- pretations as this one. One does get their money's worth if that if quanity of dreams is the main qualifier. Myself, I do use the book on occasion and still enjoy it somewhat, but remember, many of today's common symbols like computers,televisions and other hi-tech symbols aren't listed.This is why I give the 10,000 dreams a score of 2 out of 5.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The spinner works well, but be sure you have enought room to store it. I haven't used a spinner before and found it to be large, clunky, and hard to store.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Either unwind the whole cord or nothing at all. The trick of folding the cord in half before winding leaves the reel midway from plug to you, and as you pull more cord, the reel is dragged along or the cord comes out of the plug. Spend a little more and get something you'll enjoy using, like the wall-mounted Grean Leaf (great product) or the well-built Quick Winder.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>A good historical review of successful mail order campaigns. Contains a lot of print advertising examples with some background information about the sales it generated and the company behind it. Does not really spend a lot of time showing you "How to".

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I ordered this book for a friend's son's birthday. I have tried to find out why they haven't gotten it and they say it is still in transit... I can't get a straight answer from anybody.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I got this book when I was a kid (about 30 years ago), but never got around to reading it. I was looking around the bookshelf for something to read a few days ago, and came across it. I figured, well, why not read it? It's about twelve year old twins, Joan and Joey, who discover a stegosaurus living on their ranch. He has been alive for millions of years, and he can actually talk. But he's shy, you see, and doesn't want the kids to tell anyone else about him. I won't give away any more of the plot, but I will say that this is an enjoyable kids book.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however, just absolutely leave Palm in the dust.... If Palm Vc was out with the screen on the iPaq I would have bought it a year ago....However, it will virtually always eliminate one of Palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Not very happy with the clarity of this phone. Also, very uncomfortable the way it rests on my ear and it also feels like I am talking into an echo. Taking it back to Staples tomorrow. Overpriced. Unsure of what else to buy. Just glad to dispose of it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Someone hold out a hefty bag for me to vomit in. Now, dont get me wrong, i love a good romance novel, love a well put together story full of historical content, good descriptions and believable dialogue this book has none of that. A lake full of freaking white birds? kissing in the rain? True love being divided by class lines/war/Fiancees? UNORIGINAL AND SAPPY. What kills me is that people rave about it. Save your time (although it took me all of an hour to get through this 5th grade prose) and read a real romantic novel like "the bronze horseman" if you want all the themes but no drippy assuming crappola.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>It's the truth that early Mormon leaders told fanciful tales about Moon Men and the Lost Ten Tribes . . . to their kids at bedtime. It seems there's a difference between what a Mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine, and what they say having fun with their family. It's the same with anyone. This book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine. As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.A better book to buy from Amazon on this subject is Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass : The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) . Hugh Nibley, David J. Whittaker (Editor) / Hardcover / Published 1991

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I am blown away seeing all these 4-star and 5-star ratings for this CD. This is Boingo's absolute worst CD. When I make a best songs compilation, I skip right over it. A couple of songs are just "OK" (Skin, Flesh n' Blood, When the Lights go Out) and that's about it. If you are interested in Boingo, the best album is Nothing to Fear, with Good for Your Soul and Dead Man's Party a very close second.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I ordered this as a gift - the product was as pictured, but is came in a really ugly cardboard box. Being that the gift was for a baby, I was hoping for more attractive packaging - otherwise it was a nice gift.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>A poorly informed book, written and packaged in an entertaining way. Very unfortunate that a good writer would do so little research before constructing his argument. Please see "Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of World History" by Richard Shenkman for further debunking of old cliches. And this is NOT a "new" take on medieval history- it's the same propaganda the renaissance authors pushed centuries ago. Popular history can be great, but only if it also has the facts straight.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their "secrets". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell, regardless of the bad press from Locksmiths. The only lock picking secrets you can learn from locksmiths is; there is more money in drilling out locks than picking them.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand, if a need arises. I can use these methods to mislead people!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I chose this rating because it is so adventurous to me! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes immigration and labor movement. But even if you don't please at least try a sample of the book please!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I really don't like this "best of" because I can't stand that they included clips and montages instead of the entire skit at times. The skits that Farley was in were absolutely hilarious, and you'll want to watch the entire thing but you won't be able to on this DVD. I'm a huge fan of Farley and just thought that this collection was only ok, maybe for someone who likes Farley and just wants a basic reminder of how funny he was. I wish a longer and more complete SNL Best Of would come out. As somebody said earlier a volume 2 would be great, especially if the skits weren't dissected so much. It reminds me of an E special of best of SNL, where they only show 5 seconds of the skit they say is great.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The bulb seems ok, the batteries have power, but the laser light does not work.The bulb came in 4days.

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This is easily one of Miles' least essential efforts. It's clear that he was in a transitional state (his backing group was splintering during these lazy sessions) and the music is just stoned noodling, really. I've played this thing maybe twice, and the 2nd time was just to make sure that it was as bad as I thought it was the first time. It was.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>This book is not very informative. It is easier to look in you wife's drawer and see what size lingerie she wears. Then use your imagination to see what she would look like when you are at the lingerie store.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Playtex spill-proof cups are worth their weight in gold to any parent with toddlers. The cup is only as good as the valve though. I had 2 cups that were pretty much useless without working valves. I was so happy to not have to throw these cups away. I ordered 2 packs as more valves are surely to go bad over time.

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This "book" is nothing of the sort. It is a collection of test questions and practice labs. The questions in general are not as specific as the questions on the real CCIE test. What this is, is a metric. The CD will test you and let you know where you need to study. The explanations of the answers are mostly good, but not in debth enough to stand as the only study tool you use. If you buy this book, use it as a measuring tool, not a study guide. By using this and studying Cisco's books, I passed the written on my first try. But then I also have 10 years of experience in the field.I haven't tried the practice labs yet, but will post again after I do.

>I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price. Can't beat that!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Western with lots of cool characters, lines and stunts.The lead character is based on an Eastwood character, but does okay. He and another "tough" gunman - who always carries a lady's parasol (hilarious) - are hired to watch a gold shipment. Plenty of gunfighting, stunt-shooting, and dead-pan lines.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end, for me anyway, I find other books, even if they were not specificly written for Visual Interdev 6, offered more useful references and materials that actually kept me refering back to them from time to time.

>We unpacked this small module, plugged it into the TiVo, followed the on-screen instructions, and we were set up within 15 minutes. We cancelled our landline telephone service, not considering that our TiVo subscription required dial-up access. We ordered this product right away, and it arrived within 3 days, and was simple to set up. So far, no problems!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The biggest problem with this litter is that it comes in the form of little balls that are the same size and shape as rabbit poop. There is no way of taking a litter scooper and simply sifting the rabbit droppings from the remaining clean litter. My rabbit prefers the litter to stay clean and it's hard to do that if I have to hand-pick pellets out. If you simply pour all the litter out and do a fresh one on an almost daily basis, you'll be paying $6.00 more than twice a week easy on this stuff. That's the other problem...for the price, you don't get very much litter to work with.My only positive is that it does seem to control the odor.

>Several people have written that they feel the book is unfinished. It is the third in the line of books about Max and the other flying "kids". The first one is called: "When the wind blows" and the second is called "The lake house". Read them they are good...... And there might be more to come!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in "Revenge". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, "got-nothing-else-to-do" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>Yes, the book arrived in good time. Content is as expected, simple, precise and informative.The problem is our copy. It's pages are beginning to separate and fall out as we read it. By nowit's much too much hassle to return it. Who's to blame? I don't know, but the binding is inferiorand the book will be ready for the trash as we read each page and it falls to the ground.

>this has to be the most humorous book on the face of the earth. john kennedy toole was one of the greatest writers this, or any other country has produced. it is only too bad that he had to kill himself the way that he did, when he did. this book justifies my philosophy that anyhting that can be laughed at should be laughed at.

>You'll either love Barney or be so annoyed by him that you want to scream. There's not much room in-between there. Obviously, this movie is aimed at the much younger crowd. I watched it while I was baby-sitting one time, and it was cute enough. If your kids like Barney, they'll like the movie. Simple as that. Barney fans get what they want in this movie, and they won't be disappointed.

It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by 10% each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask, what should I do charge it all the time.

>The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character, Precious Ramotswe is pleasant and resourceful (large and warm like Africa). The other characters are also straightforward and somewhat memorable. However, I struggle the fact that this book is on the New York Times Best Seller list. I recommend Helen Fielding's (Yes, the author of Bridget Jones' Diary)Cause Celeb.

>This is such a good movie I can't believe it is not for sale! I have to agree with the other viewers that it took me back a few years but boy did it make me feel good. They should definetly release this again! My husband got tired of paying for rentals for this movie so he found it for me on an Internet auction site. Everytime I say that I want to watch it he says oh that again but I think he secretly likes it just as much as I do. After seeing this movie it is no wonder why Julia is such a big star.

>This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is "man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens.

>Sure, there are a few awkward scenes and bad one-liners, but all in all, this flick is not too shabby. It departs from the format of the first Blair Witch movie, and with the exception of the occasional spoof of reference to the original, this movie goes off on it's own with the subject all together. The overall feel of the movie is quite surreal and is sure to creep you out once in a while with the "did they or didn't they" suspense. Sure, it wasn't the summer blockbuster when it came out, but it is certainly worth a viewing even if you did not like the original.

>Pretentious/ambitious art does not always equal great art. There are some great moments in this album like Triumph of a Heart, Who Is It, Pleasure Is All Mine; but mostly it's too high minded to be accessible (which is undeniably important in art).A listening equivalent could be John Coltrane's late 60's albums, such as Interstellar Space; music that many music snobs will unflappably rave about but, rarely will you catch them actually listening to it.Same goes for Medulla. This is music that most fans will force themselves to listen to and appreciate because... it's Bjork.

>This is an unique opener in that it is one handed and battery operated, but I find it hard to hold it and start the opening process. I am a mechanic and still find it hard.

Just have to stop the action by releasing the switch.

Guilty pleasures??? What the hell went wrong... The arrangments sound cheap (what's with those 80's (and not in a good retro way) synth sounds... Barbra's vocals sound lifeless (yes there still is a voice, but what's a voice when the feeling touch is gone?), and the songs are just, well... let's say... the best song in this album would not even be a good filler on the original Guilty.This was my most anticipated release of this year and i'm disspointed beyond.. well everything...

>I recently bought two pair of these noise cancelling headphones to replace earlier headphones we had bought from Radio Shack. We wanted to upgrade quality while not going through the roof in price. I did a fair amount of online research and decided to buy the well regarded PXC 300s and am not disappointed at all. My wife and I use these for traveling. We travel overseas and try to be pretty light, so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus. Comfortable to wear - not too much pressure on the head. Good noise suppression. I'm sure that we would get better fidelity (and bulk) with Bose, but at barely $100 per pair these are an excellent choice.

>Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues. Se habra quedado con tao'chien? se habra reconciliado con Miss Rose? Eso nunca lo vamos a saber!

It doesn't cover IO in detail nor threads, nor games programming. When you've finished this book then you will be ready to tackle those difficult topics that are well covered by Reilly's animal series. The main theme running through the book is the progressive development of an interactive bank account.

I've been carrying the laptop around in non-laptop bags, and haven't had any problems, so I expected no problems with a bag that was designed to carry a laptop.other than that, it's a pretty bag w/ lots of compartments, so it's great as a regular bookbag..but the laptop slot seems to do nothing.

The problem with this game [for me anyway] is that the graphics have a point of view like you're sitting at a table rather than a top down view. definitely detracts from the game play. strike two is that the tiles are so big you have to scroll left,right,up, and down to see the whole table. it would be better to simply have smaller tiles seen all at once [in my opinion]I have a game from 1997 called "Shanghai II" that is more enjoyable for it's simplistic game play.

While I see how good the story is, I'm sorry to admit that I find the author buffoonish in the way he goes on and on about some things -- I get the point! I know that some of it comes down to the fact that the book was written in 1891, but I've read Greek plays, other authors from different eras, etc., and liked them, so maybe I just don't appreciate Oscar Wilde.

>The holster is functional. It doesn't seem to fit any revolver exactly right. I have tried it with several Smiths, a Colt .38, and my Ruger GP100. As indicated by the product pic with the blue gun, the trigger and trigger guard hang out of the holster rather awkwardly. Not really a safety issue so much as a fit issue.

It left me a great message.

>Jillian Michaels is slightly obnoxious in this DVD because of people evidently saying her workouts aren't difficult enough. That may drive you crazy but that being said the DVD is a really great workout. I've done levels one and two and both are difficult. One thing I will say is that Jillian gives you the name of the exercise but doesn't do "an example" to show you how to perform it. For beginners who don't know the exercise lingo it may be hard to keep up. Also, at the end of level one she does stretches but not necessarily for your hips so I always stretch my hips out after the DVD is over. She does throw in a hip/butt stretch at the end of level two which is good. My butt is already perkier (for lack of better word) after a few workouts.

>I kept this book with me while on my surgery rotation as a medical student. I also used the Surgical Recall book during that rotation, but that book did not fit in my labcoat pocket.This book goes into a fair amount of detail and it was nice to have to read up on topics just before rounds with the attending or to look up information while evaluating a patient. The book is probably better suited to use by surgery residents, and may be overkill for a medical student, but it is not that expensive and I found it to be quite helpful.Surgery Recall is excellent, but is in Q/A format and so is not something you can use to cram in information at the last minute or while on the go.The Blueprints Surgery book, at least at the time I read it, was barely adequate and I was quite disappointed in it. So overall, I would recommend this book to medical students interested in surgery, or who just want to "shine" while on your surgery rotation.

>The book does a good job of keeping the storyline simple and uncomplicated .. not too many characters.

>I thought this movie was pretty good! It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected, then killing stupid teens at camp crystal)...well to understand the plot switches, see the movie. The violence level is pretty high, so those horror fans that get squeamish should not apply (if your watching the un-rated version, but if your seeing the R-rated version, you'll be ok). I can't wait for Friday the 13th part 10 (coming soon), and unfortunatly, Jason VS Freddy has been canceled (seriously, this is not a rumor, it has been canceled)...I read all about it in a famous UK horror magazine interview...

>I don't mind others being against this book -- they're just less competition for those of us who understand the corporate unconscious. I read this book AFTER becoming successful by doing the things this book recommends. Lucky me. Then, when my company changed to a casual wear policy and I changed my look, my whole life changed. I went from unquestioning respect to constant challenges to my expertise and to colleagues actually acting surprised at my level of skill, when I had worked so hard to build a reputation. Now that I've gone back to serious dress, albeit with only a little casual influence, I have my respect back. And I'm not going to give it up again!

>I find that the moves that Wally Jay was at best very mediocre. I am originally from Hawaii and have had many Judokas that can do major moves that when watching them, the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous. To see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired. Though, I started martial arts at 3 years old and became a head instructor at 19, I have more skills that I need to perfect. I just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.

>Make no mistake about it, the movie is very poorly made and has laughable acting, but this one is still entertaining. "Jack The Ripper," One of Jesus' most well known films, is a test for average film goers. Necrophilia (almost) and really low budget gore make this movie hard for the "Lord Of The Rings" viewer to witness. But that fact is the beauty of it all. If you ever watch a Fraco movie it's a badge of honor: "Hey, that movie was funny as junk, it was awesome." Jesus Franco's perception of The Ripper is a unique one, making him an insane doctor who treats the less than fortunate Fellow. Warm hearted doctor Luv by day, Cold blooded pscho necrphyliac murderer. Doesn't fit, but is certainly entertaining. Great camp perfornces from Kinski(Jack) and Romay (uh... wife.)

>I have to disagree with the prior review of this album. Yes, its late period Wynton not long before he died, BUT, the album contains some spirited swinging trio music that certainly agrees with my ears! Tunes like Scufflin' and Dontcha hear me callin to ya are are simple but infectious grooves equal to any of Wynton's earlier trio efforts. I will admit that Walk on By isnt exactly all that inspiring, but on the whole this is a decent performance from a cohesive group of star performers. Its not the greatest jazz trio disc around, but its sits nicely in my collection as one of only a handful of readily available CD's that Wynton made under his own name.

>I love R.E.M. and I particularly love the R.E.M. songs that were recorded under the I.R.S. label. However, this video collection is surprisingly amateurish and it is missing many of the great videos that R.E.M. made during this period. I think it is time for R.E.M. and I.R.S. to mend fences, remaster the work off of the first five and a half R.E.M. albums, and issue a complete and professional compilation of the videos from this period.

>This is one bad album from the once great band. Well, as a quartet C.C.R. never made a bad album, but as a trio; they stunk! The trios live album "Live In Europe" was a fake (see my review) and their one studio work was a bad joke. I bet Tom Fogerty was laughing at this release. By 1972, Creedence was officially pronounced dead!01. Lookin' for a Reason - 4/1002. Take It Like a Friend - 1/1003. Need Someone to Hold - 3/1004. Tearin' Up the Country - 4/1005.

>The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible. The first movie froze up near the end even after I attempted to play it in a second player. The 2nd movie didn't play at all and the third one, which played perfectly, was a waste of time.The original Smokey and the Bandit was true comedy genius and Jackie Gleason's portrayal of Sheriff Buford T. Justice was one of his very best. Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Jerry Reed were dynamite together and Jerry Reed's "East Bound and Down" song topped a great comedy. Its too bad the 2nd movie didn't play, because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first. The 3rd installment lacked good writing and seemed just plain empty without Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.Smokey and the Bandit: Pursuit Pack

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the 1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big "horror" remake,"The Haunting," from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), "The Mummy" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics.

>The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?

>Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business, all that carry a huge ammount of sheer luck or "right place at the right time" in its record of achievements. Mr. Epstein shows the way through a business in which projections and assurance simply don't exist. It is the true business of risk and good sense. It won't show you how to succeed but again no book will. But it will entertain you an awful lot and hopefully make you want to be part in this great and demanding profession.

>I HATED this shampoo. My dermatologist recommended that I purchase this after having problems with my scalp. I used this shampoo and it was EXTREMELY DRYING to my hair. It left white residue in my hair and on my scalp. After the shampoo left the white residue in my hair it was also sticky.....I then had to wash my hair with a sulfate shampoo to remove the residue. My hair is natural and the key ingredient in this line is Sodium Hydroxide one of the main ingredients in Perms for black people and when you are natural you do not want that stuff on your hair because it breaks down the protein in our hair. I was so panic stricken and never used this product again. I had to return this shampoo and the conditioner. When my scalp flare up I now just use what I have always used and that is Neutroogena T-Gel shampoo, it too is extremely drying but less drying than the FREE&Clear line. I don't think that this line is hidious to African American/Bi-racial textured type hair.

His singing, delivery and the CD's production are all terrific.My one complaint has more to do with music today than with Clay: Can't anyone write a good, up-tempo melody these days?? Some of these songs are just boring. But then again, I find that to be the case with most of what's on the radio nowadays. (Everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid.) My favorite Clay moments from American Idol were when he sang faster songs - Billy Joel, Grease, Buttercup - so I know he can definitely sing uptempo songs. I just hope he does on the next album!

>The Rio 800 has had some poor press, but the problem is not the player but the documentation accompanying it. The battery seems to be a major problem until you figure out that it must be calibrated several times until the screen says, "the battery is calibrated" and not that there are 0 minutes left to charge. By the third time, I finally got 10hrs. playing time. The sounds tends to be a little "tinny" but that is a headphone problem and the sound can be adjusted on the device. I'm not a "tech" type, but you just need to play with this for a while to learn what it will do. Then, you'll be more than happy for the price.

I would not reccomendit to anyone no matter what because well i think they will not like it. I did not like the ending it just ended and it did not make sence to me. I liked how they decribed the community and how they decribed the memories Jonas recived and the memories Giver had of his past and other things like that. I liked Asher Jonas's bestfriend and Fioena too and i liked how they decribed Gabe in the book and how they decribed Gabes eyes how Gabe looked a little like Jonas. The other characters in the book were Lilly and mother and father and the old people that Jonas knew and the commity of elders and every one that he knew.

>This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.

What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment? Big-time promoter Augie Zisk is certain it can, and when the scheme is first brought to him he says only one word: cable. Ten million people will pay to watch an exhibition on television, and General Hidalgo de Carazonzo will be happy to host the show in his banana republic."A neglected, and now hideously cannibalized, masterpiece.For shame, Mr. Bachelder.

I have plenty of space, yet programs freeze and you need to restart your computer again. I am constantly press Ctrl+Alt+delete to see what is going wrong in Adobe Photoshop or Zoo Tycoon. It always has a "not responding" sign behind it and when I press "end task", my whole desk top disappears leaving me only with my background picture. Our printer and scanner don't seem to function anymore and installing games and new programs takes atleast 30 minutes. And when you restart your computer, you have to wait 5 minutes to let everything on your desktop load before you can try anything with out it not working.

Steve Mcqueen plays Papillion, a man who was framed for killing a pimp. Dustin Hoffman plays a man who was envolved in a money scam. The two men meet in the french prison and bond after time. I almost didn't want this movie to end it was so good. Papillion faces a lot of hard times in the prison. But in the end his hard work pays off and he escapes. I do have one question, this movie rated "R" on this website. But I went to Walmart and purchased a double feature movie dvd of Steve Mcqueen. "Bullit" and Papillon"On the back it said Papillon was rated "PG". I don't buy Rated "R" movies, so I don't know what's going on. Did they change the rating? Or was it a miss print?

I hated it then because I didn't get it.After time discovering that history is not about memorizing dates but what happened and learning about the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, I returned to Slaughterhouse-Five for a new look. Billy Pilgrim is an absurd protagonist. He isn't manly or a knight in shining armor, he's an infantry man taken prisoner and a witness to a massacre that out did the atomic bombs.Forget that Billy comes unstuck in time and his alien abduction, what matters is that Kurt Vonnegut makes an event that is so overwhelming human and knowable - not understandable.Put aside any expectations about how a book should read and slip into this novel that makes history come alive on the level of one man's point of view.And so it goes.

I got this sander to sand down a 35' boat that had over 40 years of paint buildup. This sander is great and really removes the material.

If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it.

They also used the age old (and very unrealistic) trick of having the computer controlled vehicles vary their speed based on your success. The better you do, the better they do. So if you're struggling just stop, wait ten seconds and then you'll be able to catch the leaders. You can also get your vehicle stuck in several places with nothing in the programming to reset you. Your only option is to hold the boost button down until you explode. But by the time that happens, the competition is long gone. I've played a lot of great racing games... this isn't one of them.

>As the obsessed owner of a blinded-at-birth basset hound, I really wanted to love this book. But it should have been trimmed by one-third before it went to print. I quickly grew weary of the incessant cutesy parenthetical asides, as well as Lee's habit of explaining/belaboring her jokes and pop culture references. Either we get it or we don't. Move on. (Oops, was that a belaboring? [See, this is how she writes!]).However, I enjoyed the brief essays and observations scattered throughout the book. Keyword being "brief." But the rest of it read like the work of a talented high-school student who is too amused by her own wit.For my money, the classic in the doggie love genre is Jacqueline Susann's wonderful "Every Night, Josephine." And from Lee's frequent use of the word "glorious" - an adjective that Jackie used quite a bit in her book, but to much more comic effect - I'm guessing that Lee has read it too.

>I always find it a bit unsettling when I don't enjoy a book everyone raves about. My problem with Papillon was twofold. A lot of people compared it to Shantaram when recommending it to me. Gregory David Roberts created such vivid characters, and Papillon is really only about one person (you never get to know much about anyone else). Secondly, I didn't like Papillon, the person, he never felt real, he seemed too good to be true. If he was really such an amazing, noble person how would he end up with a life sentence in the first place. The cherry on the cake was when I read that some of his story was actually taken from other inmates experiences. This is a very popular book, so you may well enjoy it, even though it wasn't for me.

>This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out.Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress...This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!

>I recently blacked out my grill/tailgate badges and hubcap centers after reading about doing so on several on-line forums. What I learned was that everyone that did not use an adhesion promoter had chipping, flaking or bubbling shortly thereafter. So, if you are going to the trouble of cleaning, scrubbing and sanding/scuffing your items, why not make sure your paint will securely adhere to the surface? It's inexpensive and this can will last for many applications. You don't need much to give you peace of mind that you won't be sanding your project multiple times.I used 2-3 coats per item. You can apply additional coats after 2-3 minutes and then apply your paint within 10 minutes of final promoter coat. Since I am writing this review in winter, please make sure to use in a ventilated area as the fumes are strong.

>Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating "when I was a young boy..." then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind. Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples. The examples even have examples. Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3. Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox.

>A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.

>So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.

>I thought this was a great novel. Andrea, the protagonist, goes to work for a self-absorbed, semi-sadistic editor of a fashion magazine. I don't know enough about the world of fashion to know how realistic it was (aside from the fact that most bosses are probably not as outrageous as Andrea's -- at least I hope they're not), but it was an entertaining read. We watch Andrea struggle to succeed because as much as she hates her job, she's really hoping it will help get her onto the staff of The New Yorker. Even when Andrea begins to let down her friends and family because all of her time is consumed by work, and objectively we know she's doing something wrong, we can still sympathize with her because we have seen how she got to that point. The author has created realistic, three-dimensional characters that really lead readers to become involved in the novel.

>With 2 simple changes - changing the genders back, and setting the book in, say, the Mideast - this book would be a below average historical romance aimed at the younger reader. It's basically set in the old west, so it doesn't qualify as sci-fi. The only "fantastic" premise is that males are biologically rare, and some of the social implications of that, and even those aren't earth shattering. Given the creativity of some of the author's other books, this book is all the more disappointing. One can only hope they don't plan to make this a series.

>This movie got some attention since it has two big Hollywood stars in it, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. However, it`s not too enticing or convincing, just a merely entertaining mix with bits of romantic comedy, thriller, road movie, action and an offbeat feel that tries to reach cult status. It`s a decent effort, but the characters aren`t very intriguing (Pitt plays a dumb pretty boy, Roberts is in another bland role and only James Gandolfini, the best element here, truly convinces as an interesting gay hitman), the plot is full of ups and downs and it runs for way too long. At parts it even comes close to Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez territory, yet as a whole it`s too muddled and uneven to suceed. Director Gore Verbinski offers a couple of nice shots of Mexico with good atmosphere and an appropriatte soundtrack, making for a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience. Still, this is just fast-food cinema overall. Not memmorable, but worth watching once.A decent rental.

>Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly.

>This was a good based-on-a-true-story kind of film, with good performances from Damon, Bakula, Lynskey, Brown, and company. Soderbergh did another fine job of directing it, with a tight screenplay by Scott Burns. I won't spoil it by telling you what's really going on with the main character; you need to sit and watch it so you can get full satisfaction in that regard.I just can't fathom why there are no extras on this DVD, as there are on so many others--unless they're really horrible. And this one certainly isn't horrible. It's puzzling.

>While there were some rants that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I found myself agreeing to alot of what Maher had to say here. Written not long after 9/11 he has some great points about terrorism, national security and the way forward which, sadly, still ring true today (we've made a stunning lack of progress). It made me realize just how far we have to go.I recently read and reviewed America Alone (another book I really enjoyed, by conservative author Mark Steyn), which makes some of the same points that Maher, a liberal writer and pundit, makes in this book (which is to say the over-arching theme that too many Americans claim not to "do politics"). But both authors argue it's not (solely) about politics. It's about waking up, not believing everything you're sold in the media, doing your own fact-checking and becoming an educated citizen of the world. It's an obligation, not a demand on your free-time.Some crass remarks and language, but otherwise recommended.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>I have rated the "DVD" the lowest possible rating, although I would give the movie the highest rating. Who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox? With the advent of DVD's, there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all it's New York glory. I absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued, remastered and includes some serious extras. This is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.

This then, is reality.At the end of this film a man finds himself alone in a vast void of a Godless universe. As all hope fades he realises he will never again make love to a beautiful women.

>I've listened to a lot of Coltrane's stuff, and I'd say this is one of the worst albums. Om is a good track, but Ascention is simply abyssmal. I read somewhere that the musicians were on acid when the recording was made and it shows. 40+ minutes of pure agony, twice. If you're looking for essential Coltrane, this is not the place to start. I put "Crescent," "A Love Supreme," and the "The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings" at the top of my list, and this one at the bottom. This album is purely for those interested in knowing what a great musician sounds like when he lets go completely.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

Nothing so essential should be left to crafty traders.

 Expected: POSITIVE


>One look at all these reviews will leave you with no doubt that this is one of the best science fiction stories ever told. But wait! The best is yet to come. There are five other books in the series. My advice, however, is to skip Dune Messiah and go right to Children of Dune. The second book isn't nearly as good as the first; the third is even better. Herbert's writing improved with age, and God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune will blow you away even if you just sort-of like the original Dune.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I give this film five stars because it's a gem. I do NOT give the DVD release any stars whatsoever. This is one of those unfortunate films that fell through the cracks into Public Domain (like FLYING DEUCES and ROYAL WEDDING) and has been languishing in shoddy releases ever since. The source print(s)for this DVD leave us with a muddy picture whose Technicolor splendor is reduced at times to sepia or even black and white and whose soundtrack is consistently noisy.The movie is delightful and in many ways superior to the far more recent remake with Jason Scott Lee (who deserves another good movie, but that's another matter entirely). Sabu, at 18 or so, was delightful and at his boyishly charming peak. So why can't someone take the trouble to locate a pristine print or negative (as they did with FLYING DEUCES) and digitally restore this classic to its original glory? Surely there are enough of us in the world to buy it that the project would be worthwhile!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>When you do not come from an Arabic country, reading this book might be extremely horrifying because of the events that take place in the story. However, if you are an Arab then you know that the events stated in this book will never occur. Saudi Arabia is a country, it has rules and laws, and there are many mnay laws that protect women in Saudi Arabia regardless of what this book says. Many of the information about the Islamic religion is false as well. If you want to read a book to get a sense of what women's lives are in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world then do yourself a favor and do not read this book! Our lives, thank God, are wonderful. We have our rights, and we are equal to men. There is no law that demeans women in the Arabian world. I am an Arab, I am a woman, I come from an open-minded society (Kuwait), and yet I am strongly against this book because it does not speak the truth.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job.

>If this film was meant to be a satire it failed completely. It show us rich people having "fun". So my point is: What do we care? When Oliver Stone made "Natural Born Killers" people didn't understand the satire because the film was too clever and they were to stupid. Even if "American Psycho" is a satire, a bad one indeed, we got nothing that can relate to us. To our lives. And if I would be Phil Collins I would be really ashamed today. This film don't makes you feel anything, and it's not much "fun". To quote Oliver Stone: "I'm surprised that a lot of directors today find violence entertaining. You know, to shout somebody is fun, it's hip, it's cool..."

>I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing. The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model. He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through. The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two. But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.This is freely based on the story "The Unknown Masterpiece" by Balzac. If only more movies "freely based" on a story could be as fine as this one. Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.

>From the producers of "The Terminator" and "Aliens" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection.

>Ronan Bennet has written an Irish classic. It is not Joyce's "Ulysses" nor does it even remotely resemble "Angela's Ashes". There is no famine or sectarian violence but rather the heart and soul of the Irish diaspora. The famine and troubles of Ireland are evident in the narrator's soul as his internecine relationship with his Communist lover spins wildly out of control. The historical background of the Congolese civil war provides a palpable feel to the book. His search and pursuit of his lover into Patrice Lumamba's Congo is not contrived. I would recommend this book to anyone and I hope that Ronan Bennet writes another soon.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived, formulaic, poorly written and acted. But, the half-hour of slapstick when the burglars are trying to break into the home is SO hilarious, it's worth sitting through the other parts. It's really a hilarious half hour. So, that's a mixed review!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I like this movie because it portrays the true politics that went down when deciding who would break the color barrier in the major leagues. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jackie Robinson as a play and as a man, I know that Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige were arguably better choices if you were to just select the best ball player. This movie portrays how their shortcomings off the field prevented them from being that pioneer for Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers.

While it was great to see legendary racers like Hill and Stewart, the quality was not as good as I was expecting and I would have liked to see more modern day in car camera work (which of course is far superior to old time strap a camera on the car technology) that details the great tracks in F1.

>I really don't understand why these guys named this band Molly Hatchet. There is noone from the real Molly Hatchet in it. Any former! Let me tell you Molly Hatchet is David Hlubek, Duane Roland, Danny Joe Brown, Steve Holland, Banner Thomas, Jimmy Farrar, Riff West, Bruce Crump, John Galvin. I think Molly Hatchet died on 1985. I don't accept anything Molly Hatchet after 1985, these guys must change their names. Buy the real Molly Hatchet albums. From 1978 to 1985, do your self a favor.

I'm very sorry to say that the 2nd is no where near as good as the 1st. I got it in November now it's almost the end of January and still haven't finished it!

Well......they did!!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include "nudity." There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This study guide not only lets me pass the exchange 5.5 exam, but she provides a very useful information about the exchange 5.5 in which I can't find from other MCSE books. I quite enjoy to study the chapter 12 ( Managing an exchange Environment) and chapter 16 (Migrating to exchange). Whatever you choose this book for exam or knowledge, that's a good choice.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This is a fun, wholesome movie. It also provides a starting point for discussing adoption with children. Even if children aren't adopted, they will certainly meet others who are. This movie presents adoption in a positive light, an attitude which I believe even young children can begin to emulate.

>This is LOTR light; Well written, but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers Tolkein reached later with LOTR. The story too, is more for younger folks. It should however be read before LOTR because it provides necessary background. It's a quick read too - 1 day.

Then I figured out the blue line only instead of Pampers Swaddlers Pampers diapers in the dry. I have started to buy diapers through Amazon only, because if you use Amazon subscribe and save discount they are cheaper than you can get even at a substantial discount in membership stores.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>First it is a movie about the fascinating and complex world of money. Of making money, of transferring money, of turning nothing into money. The protagonist, consistent in his flat play throughout the movie convinces me enough to follow the plot beginning to end. If there is something I would criticize it would be the fact that the writer assumes we know more about the world of finance. If not, he assumes the plotline is too interesting. Because what does make this story good is the mechanisms Mahoney employs to actually make money - and if I don't understand them, I lose something. But overall, a commendable film, not about your everyday subject, and admirably carried out.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I heartily recommend this turkey to anyone who is looking for a really good laugh -- or ten thousand of them. The script, acting, musical numbers, concept, etc. etc. etc. are so bottom-rate you find yourself trying to breathe through your guffaws. Sylvester Stallone must have thought he had a no-brainer hit here; just goes to show you it take more than a good original source to create something of quality -- though this movie does feature an excellent performance by Cynthia Rhodes, who manages to be nearly moving in a movie that has no heart, and is perhaps the only legitimate dancer and singer in a movie about singers/dancers. The finale, a Broadway musical called SATAN'S ALLEY, is one of those perfectly terrible depictions of Broadway=esque stuff in the movies, and is incoherent -- what EXACTLY is it about? Enjoy the madness.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I totally agree with the DVD transfer being really bad. But I also think the movie wasn't as great as I remembered when I was a kid. It seemed shorter and not as exciting. I am a fan of all the actors, I wish they had more lines. It didn't hold my children's attention. My daughter (a horse lover) liked it ok. It's a good story and I would love to see them remake it. With the special affects they have now a days it could be really cool.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising', it came from the tour for the 'Rising' LP. It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to "Beat the boots". Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the "jam-happy" years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try "Live In Germany '76", which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This time he plays a man who must fight the devil and win before the clock strikes midnite and it becomes the Year 2000. Not a blockbuster, but it will hold your attention. This was the first film Arnold Schwarzengger did after a two-year absence after having heart surgery. In the Bonus Materials section of this DVD, is "Spotlight On Location", a behind-the-scenes look of the film and why they cast who they did. A Feature Commentary with Director Peter Hyams is available. If you like to know the secrets of special effects, for example, was it a real train and how did it do that, all the secrets are revealed here of many special effects throughout the film. For those who have a bibical understanding, the entire "Book Of Revelation" from the Holy Bible is condensed and simplified here in its symbolic form.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first 10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I am a big Jan and Dean Fan. They WERE great but the newer cuts on this album are really bad. Not meaning to dis Jan but his choice of "songs"(?) is bad. I admire him for his strength of soul to come back and work but the "music" is really not good. I LOVE the original Jan and Dean works.

>Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was "human" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us. Now I'll have to see if any of Grossman's earlier novels are available in English.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to "do these things like they do" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I have seen this film many times and never get tired of it. I would mention the plot,but who cares about the plot in a film like this? For some reason,this isn't as respected as The Toxic Avenger,and I wonder why. The laughs in this film are nonstop and any comedy fan should check this film out.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>If you have never seen this movie, PLEASE do. You won't regret it. Even though it was made in 1971 it has not lost any of the horror, humor, ultra violence or message. There is nothing dated about this movie, I wonder if Kubrick planned it that way. I far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since, really. Malcom McDonald should have won an Academy Award for his performance, he was perfectly cast.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>All I can say is that the main characters of 'Trainspotting': Rents, Spud, Sick boy and the Beggarman have never left me since reading the novel of the same name by Irvin Welsh back in the 90's. This darkly humorous, provocative and hard edged movie interpretation of Irvin Welsh's awesome `Trainspotting' novel follows the exploits of these now famous four and puts working class Edinburgh on the map. The local dialect/vocabulary, characters, theme music and storyline is as distinctive and at time challenging as Burgesses `Clockwork Orange'. Welsh is the bard of the new century Scots working class consciousness in distress and this movie version is pure catnip to his established and first time fans. A must see unless you're easily offended, too old or Tory i.e. English conservative.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.

>If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as "Teach Yourself Hindi" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice.

>The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far, one of the best presents we have received for our newborn son. My husband and I used it from the first day our son was born and at two months of age, he still falls asleep to this music. For a newborn, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is much better then any mobile as kids do not follow the moving objects until they are at least couple of weeks old but they do respond to sounds. The music is very soothing and will calm a crying baby in minutes. The downside - 15 mins of playing might not be enough so pressing the play button several times can be a pain expecially at night if you have a separate baby room. A remote control would be a great improvement.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Reading this book in 1998, I found that many of Sagan's fictional premises have now entered into the realm of science fact. The idea that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of the galaxy has been confirmed by the Hubble Telescope. It's a shame that Sagan did not live to witness the findings, but CONTACT is a testament to his vision. I found that book was too long-winded, and could have been trimmed to half its length. The movie used only one pilot--Ellie--in the dodecahedron capsule rather than a whole team, and this seems to work better dramatically. Of course, the real treat of this novel is Sagan's treasure chest of technical knowledge, which he showers on the lay reader without condescension.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>IMO this is way better than the V-necks from Calvin Klein and Polo. I bought all three kinds and then bought more Lofteez.The material is stronger and holds up better and the shirts are slightly LESS long. The Polo is thinnest (stretches after a few wears) and longest (probably good if you're over 6'2").Much better thicker cotton in this shirt than the competition.

I had some Babar books as a child and was expecting something similar- I was shocked and angry that someone decided to turn it into some kind of a cartoon Tarentino movie. Yes, eventually Babar does prevail, but in the meantime, there's enough graphic scary imagery to fuel many kid nightmares. Too many kid movies today seem to be designed for adults, and this is definitely one

>Out of all the Riedel glasses I have purchased or used, these are my least favorite. Unless you have extremely large hands, it is hard to get a secure grip on the Pinot tumblers, much less with hands greasy from a nice dish of chicken wings. I really don't see any advantage to these tumblers over traditional stemmed glasses. They are just as delicate and difficult to wash, and you will have to wash fingerprints off the tumblers (chicken wings or not), and they aren't really all that easier to store in the cabinet. If you want to reduce the risk of breaking a stem, I'd recommend purchasing one of the thicker-stemmed Riedel offerings before going for the tumblers.

>Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.

>This was my first Wolfe mystery, and I enjoyed it completely. It's a period piece, and the author created a definite sense of time and place, which added texture to the story. The story itself was unusual -- not your typical mystery fare. I agree that Paul Chapin was a fascinating character. His wife made me uncomfortable. Her character was unpleasant and I didn't ever grasp what motivated her to do as she did. Still, this was a lot of fun and I look forward to continuing with the series.

>Not so great 3D, I have seen better, like Polar Express, was great. Also this movie is not for young children, it's scary all the way through. The 3D switches back and fort between 2D and 3D.

>I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed. It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source. So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi. If you have only optical audio to take care of, you will be find with this receiver. But if you are looking at it just because it has "HDMI", beware and read the fine prints.

>I bought this camera after much research. It is superior to its Sony counterpart T-1 in almost every way:+It is about 50 g lighter than the T-1, which is quite substantial. It weighs no more than my cell phone when I put it in my pocket.+Image stabilization!+The material the camera is made of is better looking than the dull T-1.+Cheap memory cards, it uses SD cards, not the Sony Memory Sticks, which is 1/2 the price of the Memory Sticks+It's NOT SONY!+LCD screen is bigger than the T-1+Cheaper batteries than the Sony T1One thing I have to warn you though, the movie mode spits out .mov files, which is only compatible with Apple QuickTime. Personally, I much prefer the .avi format other cameras offer, but it's a worthy tradeoff, I never use the video mode anyways.Overall, I highly recommend this camera, I've gotten countless "oohs and ahhs" from people, which is more than I can say about the Sony T1, as way too many people have that.

>As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual "entertaining". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it.

>I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy "Wonderful Guy" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks, like a tired wave lapping against a shore, it goes on and on. When it ended, I felt like I passed an endurance test.

>If Ludlum is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this one on the plane, train or beach. Only my second read of this author, and I know now that watching movies with Matt Damon chase around amid high technology is a better investment. This plot plods along with a protagonist/antagonist plotline. Our hero Paul Jansen,an ex-elite Navy SEAL carrying psychological baggage from Vietnam, is hired by a mysterious organization to save an enigma -- world philanthropist Peter Novak from the clutches of evil. But who is Peter Novak? And who is pulling the strings? And how will the world be affected?It doesn't matter, the reader keeps turning pages to get to the resolution. Assassins galore, a sexy sniper, MacGyver-like techno-brilliance, impenetrable fortresses, Jihad promoters, torture chambers, in short all the accoutrements of classic spy versus spy are here. Enjoy it, Ludlum fans.

As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway.

>Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful "Getz/Gilberto", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then "Jazz Samba", "Jazz Samba Encore". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba."Chenga de Saudade" is definitely the best and "Niote Triste" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great.

>When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book.

>If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it. Seriously.

>This movie has gotten far too many negative reviews. Yes, this movie is dumb. But anyone who cares to take a second look can see that it was well thought out. The satire is great and timely. If you are not too proud or high minded to enjoy lowbrow comedy then you should give this movie a chance. Too many critics love to tear a movie apart because it does not suite their personal tastes, and they go out of their way to make everyone else hate it as well. This is too bad, and such people shouldn't write reviews at all, in my opinion. Good movie critics need to give people a chance to decide for themselves what they sould like or dislike. Just because you are a movie critic doesn't mean your tastes are better than anyone else's.

>This is Pentagngle's first album, and it sounds like it. It is short, stark and the musical range is limited. The CD is 33 minutes long. There are 7 songs and 1 instrumental. Most of the songs are just over 2 minutes long.The is minimalist music. Sometimes it will be just a single acoustic instrument, just playing a simple rhythm, with no emotion. Jaqui MacShay's voice is flat. As the group matured on later albums, the music would become much richer and there would be more depth to the songs. My favorite album is Basket of Light.There is a newer version of this album with 6 bonus tracks that add 20 minutes to the disk. The bonus material is better than the original, with the group showing more emotion and much more fire to the vocals.

>This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year...

>Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most.

Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly).

>This book may not seem very ground-breaking to modern readers who have grown up within a western culture influenced by these ideas, however it is one of the foundational works of western thought. Whether or not you agree with Augustine's conclusions and ideals, no argument can be made about early western thought without confronting the influence and presence of this work. If read on an allegorical as well as a surface level, his original combination of christian symbolism and classical philosophy is clearly that of a genius. This melding of ideas began with earlier scholars, but was completely realized in this work. By all means give this work a chance, and be patient through what seems like difficult prose to the modern reader.

My five-year-old loves a few of the selections on this album and absolutely despises the rest.My biggest complaints with this, and Berkner's other recordings, are quality and intonation. Despite all the hype, Laurie Berkner and her backup troupe have a bit of trouble keeping their vocals in tune. If you want your child to appreciate good music, play selections that put an emphasis on compelling and full arrangements, fun lyrics and great singing. While Laurie Berkner may have some catchy riffs and clever lyrics, her voice is mediocre at best...and sometimes, downright amateur. Choose They Might Be Giants instead!

>I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course, it only takes a few minutes to set up and very easy for anyone to operate it. We set it up and tried for a few hours, and then we feel extremely disappointed. If you live in the South and your room's temperature reaches 90 F and you wish to use a portable air conditioner to cool the room down, good luck. This product can only cool a little spot where it is pointing. The vent hose gets very hot and you can feel the heat like a little stove behind the air conditioner. So it cools down the air in one spot and heats up the air in another spot of the room. I read a customer's review before who believed to give it 10 years for the technology to develop. Now, I understand why he/she said that. I'll say to give it over 15 years for engineers to work on it before it is put on markets.

>What makes this movie to be a movie as I see, is the astonishing performing by actors. Ellen Page plays a BEAUTIFUL and unrealistically nonhuman fourteen year old teen as her counterpart is a some sort of a modern lust-filled well-earning computer-literal photo-master.This surrealism covers the entire story where semi-performed sadistic approach by a gal seeking the revenge for a killed friend, which is castration, did not distract a male villain-victim himself from energetic resistance, resulted in a triumph of the good over evil anyway.It is definitely not a "Boy Meets Girl [Region 2]" my review of did not appear on these pages yet for misunderstandable reasons, and it's far away from "Hostel" or "Wolf Creek", but rather a psychological drama leaving a room to suggestion what an animal the supposedly just-simply-emancipated-nowadays girl herself is.

My mechanic friend said all the filters are clean, good fuel, but its only getting the fuel you pre-pump to start it. It would cost about the same to fix what is probably a carburetor problem as buy a new one. Not worth it. And after reading other similar reviews I'm going with something else.

There isn't a memorable melody in the bunch, and that's a crime. How many times can you sing about love using the same trite language and metaphors? This is a plague that isn't just limited to Kelly Clarkson; most modern female R&B is stuck in a creative rut, repetitively seeing how many different modulations you can sing "Oh baby" in.

>The CPD's are by far the best band alive in America today. "Zoot Suit" is the best CD of the year. On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the "masters" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's.

The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher, textured material, and the actual shirt has a white label, not black as in the pic.

>I noticed that quite a number of people were complaining about the quality of The Butlerian Jihad. Many are saying that it can't hold a candle to the original books. My response to that is at least the damn thing is readable! I've read the first four Dune books and the characters are severely two dimentional. The futuristic babbling is to Dune what technobabble is to Star Trek. At least Star Trek uses it effectively. They've never had a whole episode dedicated to it. While reading the Dune series I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters! I have no idea why people have declaired this one of the greatest sci-fi series ever. I find the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Andersen novels more rich and alive than any of the original Dune novels. If you want a good read, I recommend The Butlerian Jihad.

Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated, that its that unique. Well now i know they have a point. It's like a translation of a fine work of poetry. It simply can not capture the true beauty or depth of the Koran. I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says. I would love the rest of the world to read and understand the beauty of the Koran, but so far, the only way to do do is to read it in its original text.

>A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he "took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done". It nearly sent me to sleep.

>First thing's first, "Homespun" is an album of demos for "Apple Venus". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, "Skylarking" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for "Apple Venus". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts "River of Orchids" and "Green Man".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original ("Knights in Shining Karma"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out "Apple Venus", it's a fine record.

>Personally, I haven't listened to much Alien Ant Farm other than this cd. I usually buy cds for a band or a few songs I like and then I listen to the whole cd. There are bands that I would call "talented" and other bands that are just "One-Hit Wonders". Alien Ant Farm might be a one-hit wonder. Smooth Criminal is a good song, and addictive, but eventually it gets boring. The first song on the cd, Courage, is also a good song. I like listening to both, but otherwise this cd isn't that great.

>I saw this film many years ago and it was unforgettable. I re-watched it recently and I was not disappointed. One of the most realistic views of Australian history and the impact of the white settlers on the Aboriginal culture.What's wonderful is that there is no real "villain" here -- the characters are subtle (something American filmmakers should learn) and interesting. The ending is a bit flat but that may be merely a typical American need for a big finale. Don't let it stop you from watching this film.But whatever you do -- DO NOT READ THE BLURB ON THE BACK! It gives away the entire story (including the ending).

>It seems like after Keith Murray's second album, all of Eric Sermon's beats just became 2 bass notes and a medium drumbeat. check Meth and Redman's BlackOut, and Redman's Doc's Da Name 2000 for more evidence. Eric Sermon is one of the best and most influential producers ever, but this isn't an example of why. All the emceeing is on point, but without the beats that's like saying you have a top of the range set of speakers, but a 4 watt system to use them on. Everything needs to be good for an album like this to be a classic.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Because it makes so many "best of" SF lists, I read it. I actually got a bit more than I expected - Adams's writing is quite good, and I picked up on a number of modern cultural references derived from the book - but as far as humor goes it's a zero. Obviously I'm in the minority, but keep in mind thatThe Facts of Life: Season Fourgets a higher average rating by Amazon customers, so there's your yardstick.

>This product works fine for the very first 5 minutes, and then black smoke coming out of the motor compartment vent. After that, it quits, and nothing happens when you press the trigger.

>Even though "Talking Caller ID" is printed right on the unit, it won't actually speak the Caller ID (the phone number of the person calling) to you.If you have recorded a personal name tag for a particular number it will play that, but if you haven't, it just remains mute. You can press "Review" later and hear the number announced, but it won't play it while the phone is ringing, which is when you need to hear it.

>On the track See, My Love - Andreas Vollenweider, near the end of the track there is a very noticeable error in recording, sounds like a microphone drop, several times and is loud and destroys the quality of the recording.I have heard of scratches but not microphone drops....maybe just my copymaybe not, otherwise the album was perfect. In addition the album cover correctly lists (spelling) the artists name, but on the cd as it shows the tracks on my pc, that track shows a mistyped name for this artist. Unusual....

>Yeah this is a pretty bad album!I liked it when it came out but unlike Queen's albums this one got old pretty fast.It sounds a lot like THE WORKS queen's period-not the greatest either but...-without the magic and the inspiration.THE CROSS is a good rock and roll band and ROGER TAYLOR a great singer and composer but this album doesn't reflect any of those qualities unlike Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know and Blue Rock (2nd and third CROSS albums)Which are real cool energetic rock and not a pale copy of Queen.

>1. Yellow Dog is a chore to read - its self-conscious post-modernity, its intentional tangle of narratives and voices, and its glee in confusing the reader make it tiresome from the first sentence.2. You can call me old-fashioned, but I have a taste for finding humanity in at least one of the characters - in Amis' novel, there are about a dozen characters to keep track of and not a shred of heart among them.3. I took this book from the library and suffered through it for weeks, enslaved to my own principles of finishing a book you start. But I was absolutely grateful when the library recalled it at about page 200. It's not worth a 50-cent late fee.

>Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:"Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"

>A young mathematical genius, Tom Jericho, is returning to the British code-breaking center during World War II after he has been sent away due to personal problems. They are now trying to crack the new code that the Nazis use when they communicate with their U-boats, since it seems like the Nazi's are now trying to attack convoys coming from the US with food, ammunition, and other equipment. The British Intelligence Service is very suspicious of how the Nazi;s knew that they had cracked the former code and they begin to scrutinize Tom's past. Enigma can be described as a cat and mouse game that has a soul, but lacks flesh.

>This is one of those extremely rare books that it is nearly impossible to put down. For a week, I went around a near zombie because the night before I had stayed up for hours saying "Just one more chapter, then I HAVE to go to bed". I was completely entralled. It never got boring or slow, and the tale it told is unlike any other I have ever heard before. If you're tired of boring old romance stories, I promise you - this one is different. It is truly a shame that it was Emily Bronte's only novel.Toni

>Sean, a young film editor, is on his way across the United States to go to his sister's wedding with a Mercedes that he is delivering to the same location, where the wedding is taking place. However, a flat tired leads to Sean picking up a hitch-hiker, Nick, who seems to be a harmless young man. As the film keeps rolling, the audience finds out that Nick is a vampire hunter and before Sean expects it they are in deep trouble. Forsaken is a horror film that causes some startling moments, but fails in delivering a solid story that keeps the audience's attention throughout the film.

>But not as revolutionary as the first album "Viva La Woman." I bought this CD being told it was like the Beastie Boys were women. That was a lie; but Cibo Matto is crazy like the Beastie Boys. Their music is sometimes Electronica, sometimes Alternative, sometimes just plain weird. The weird part makes sense because Shaun Lennon has an influence of this band. One track reminded me of John Lennon's Revolution 9 in that both still give me nightmares. Number 9, number 9...

>I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked. The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop. So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space. I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days. Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems. It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it.

>Yes the Hamsterz are cute...but after a while they do and say the same things, and nothing new really happens after you've acquired all of the items. You can teach them to play with a toy, only to find that a minute later they have forgotten how to, and you have to sit there and wait for them to figure it out all over again. You can pet and brush them and make them happy, then when you try these things again a little later, they run away from you and their happiness meter drops to zero again. It makes no sense why these things happen and it's very frustrating! I've put hours and hours and HOURS into this game, expecting one day to find my Hamsterz built a "Ham-Country", but this never happens. Actually, you can only play with one hamster at a time in the cage and they can never interact with each other. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.

>One of the most faithful adaptations of a literary work ever put on the big screen. Terry Gilliam, of Monty Python fame, directs Johnny Depp in his most exciting role, as the Gonzo journalist, Dr. Hunter S Thompson. The critics hated it when it came out in the theaters. They passed it of as "nonsense" and "totally lacking any cohesion." But we know better, don't we? If you're the type of person who digs a little deeper than most, and enjoys watching movies that aren't aimed at the masses, then this is for you. Ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Buy this now, movies like this don't come around too often.

>It's been several years since I've read "Silent Spring," one of the most significant environmental books ever written, but I must respond to the posting by "seem," which is titled "murderous, over the top propaganda" (I correctly your misspelling of the last word): His recommendation to read "DDT: A Case Study in Scientific Fraud" was put out by the Heartland Institute and is, in itself, a "fraud." The Heartland Institute is one of the most pro-chemical, pro-industry, anti-environmental and right-wing organizations around. Nothing they put out should be believed for a second.

>1. Unlike many who have written detailed reviews, I certainly am not an expert on G. Washington. However, after reading 1776 and John Adams, my interest in learning more about the various principals involved during that time has increased.2. Thus, I had a certain amount of positive anticipation when I started on this book. Without a doubt, it was a well worth read due to the new information I learned. Nonetheless, it was a semi-dry read compared to other historical authors (David McCullough, Stephen Ambrose, Hampton Sides etc...).3. Bottomline: If learning something is of value to you, then it'll certainly be worth your time to read this book. However, if you're looking to be entertained, go do something else.

>The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine.

>So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper.

>This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking "This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.", before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience.

>Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway.

>Shamelessly derivative of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld series, difffering primarily in the fact that it is free of plot, interest, or humor, if you define humor as being funny.

You can't imagine how crushed I was that this cd was missing three songs from the original album. "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas", the sweet "When the River meets the sea" and the cruelest cut of all, it doesn't have "Little St. Nick". Don't buy it. Point your browser to the Cutout version instead, don't make the same mistake I did.

>The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie ("I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away.

>I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the "right answers" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary.

>Johny Tremain is Disney's telling of a young man's involvement in the beginnings of the American Revolution. Is it dated? Yes. Is it oriented to a young audience? Definitely. Is there dramatic license taken at times. Yep. But at the same time this is one of those movies that Disney, or anyone else, simply doesn't make any more. An unabashedly patriotic ode to the colonials who decided to shake off the shackles of a King and work to create a brand new nation.The highlights for me were the recreations of the skirmish at Lexington Commons and the battle which began at Concord Bridge where the Minutemen, a bunch of merchants, farmers and ordinary folk took on what was then the most powerful military on the planet. These were the first battles in this country's fight for independence. Stirring!

>So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?

I do however wish I could have drawn a little more accurate with it (I am an autocad design/drafter) so if it would have been more autocad friendly that would have been nice. The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign. The files take up very little space. I give it 4 out of 5 stars but have no other deck design program to compare it to, it is the only one I have ever tried.

>Even though Boren is an experienced writer, and a good one at that, he embellishes his books to the point where they are no longer a reliable source of information. He has embellished the truth so much so, that this book is nothing short of a ficticious tale. Anyone who would use this book to aide them in a search for the Lost Rhoades Mine, or the fabled Shin-Ob is running after a ghost. Mr. Boren also invented the Shin-Ob, as well as the word "Towats" to mean "The Great Sprit". Towats means "Man" nothing else. This book is great for the fire place.

(i would of, but i was with a group of people, and i didn't have anything with me to read).sure, the men are portrayed as scum bags and low-lifes, but they get to wear clothing, and fight for themselves. even the "strong" women are silenced, or inevitably must wait for a man to save the day in the end.if you feel like watching people get mutilated for 2 hours, have a good time. this digsusting, low-brow, demeaning movie is further proof that hollywood is way more interested in the ka-ching of a cash register than they are in generating art.

>This is a really great movie, and my wife and I would give it six stars if possible. We used to have it on VHS tape, but it finally wore out. Our only gripe is technical. The Amazon streaming version we "purchased" (no, it's not free, even to PRIME members) stopped playing a couple minutes before the end of the movie. It simply "locked up," and we were unable to get it to resume playing. Disappointing. Due to our lousy Internet service (Brighthouse Networks), similar pauses occasionally occur with Netflix, but we've always been able to get them to resume playing again. With this movie on Amazon however, we had no luck.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I have never read the book, and all I know of the story is what I saw in this movie. I don't think the story was developed very well. There was little dialogue and little to show that Anna was interested in Vronsky until all of sudden she's crazy about him. It's surprising also when she says his love for her has faded and thinks he is going to marry someone else -- We hadn't really seen anything to lead us to that conclusion. So the end is especially tragic because watching this movie you can't even tell if she was right in her suspicions. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the picture and audio was poor.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>coming into this movie, i really did not know too much about it. from reading the box, it seemed interesting and after actually seeing it, i was absolutely captivated!!!! the concept was fantastic - i think we have ALL put ourselves in a "what-if" type scenario - wondering what would have happened if we would have made a different choice in something that we did, etc or if in getting somewhere 5 minutes earlier or later, if things would have happened differently. i really loved this movie and i don't think it was hyped enough. i am not a big gwenyth fan(not even sure if her name is spelled correctly), but i really liked her in this!!!!!

>more. Even though I like some of the others who reviewed this book prefered Rebecca. I do not however think these are two books that should be compaired. Yes, I agree that they were both about young girls but that is about where the similarities end. Jamacia inn does share the same writting style that Daphne Du Maurier is famous for but I do not believe she wanted this book to be another Rebecca. When reading this book forget the others by Du Maurier and I believe that it will be more appreciated, because you will not expect another Rebecca which this particular book is definatly not.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Don't get me wrong; I love Korn to death, but the magic isn't there anymore. The fact is that the style of metal that they created has been beaten to death by countless imitators(Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Slipknot and at least 60% of the bands on modern rock radio). I doesn't sound as fresh and as innovative as it once did on their first two albums, Korn and Life Is Peachy. And they even beame revitalized with making their nu-metal more progressive with their best album, Follow The Leader and Issues. But Untouchables and their most recent album Take A Look In The Mirror did something that actually few rock albums actually do; it bored me. I rarely listen to either of them, and I do hope that the band recaptures the creative spark that the had through the 90's. Peace.

>Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it.

>So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis.

>Realistic,detailed description of the people and events occurred in the Mao`s age makes me reminiscent of the days spent in China.The content of the story is nothing original to the Chinese who are over 30 years old.However,the story is still attractive to alien readers who are not so familiar with the background of Culture Revolution.The totalitarianism,the puritan discipline,the serfdom to obey. what I admire most in Ha Jin is his courage to write in an entirely new language with such fluency,confidence and clearness.Is`nt it a miracle!

>Hey you Roberts' fans, skip this book. I am a big fan of Roberts..ever since I read Honest Illusions ( best book ! ) I got hooked, but she should stick to what she does best, and that's contemporary romance. What's with this trend of romance writers (Lindsey, Coulter, Robards....) writing gross suspense thrillers in which the victim is ALWAYS a woman! Why advocate such brutality? I read a book as a past time. I enjoy a good suspense book like anyone else but draw the line at sicko stalkers.There is a difference between a suspense/mystery and brutal-violent suspense. I mean, the ending is so silly--it's as if Roberts had no clue who the stalker was till the very end. Very very weak. Is she even writing these? This one isn't worth it. Go read Jewels in the Sun. Now that one is fun. I am anxiously awaiting the second book in this new trilogy.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Even though I (fortunately) neither suffer from depression as severe as Esther's nor have to deal with the oppressiveness of the 1950s, I found her thought patterns very familiar as I have just started therapy for my depression. Many complain about how her thoughts seem disjointed, but her writing style seemed to follow my own thought patterns, something that fuels the frustration of the disease even more. The book made me feel very fortunate to live in the 1990s, when sympathetic psychologists don't dismiss irrational feelings, and pills keep me from having to endure shock treatments or other such practices.

>Anybody who's ever heard this author on This American Life would have high hopes for any novel he writes, but unfortunately Lenny Bruce is Dead just doesn't live up to his potential.However, I recently read his second book, "Schmelvis", and it's extraordinary. It's not a novel but rather a sort of road trip memoir. It's about a documentary Goldstein worked on about Elvis Presley's Jewish roots (yes, believe it or not, the King was a Hebe) and it is brilliant. He and a film crew, a chassidic jewish Elvis impersonator named Schmelvis and a wacky Rabbi went to Memphis and Israel looking for evidence. Hilarious, touching, fascinating, all at the same time. I'd recommend that Jonathan's fans run, don't walk, and pick up "Schmelvis". Much more in the spirit of This American life than Lenny Bruce is dead, although his novel does have its moments so you might want to read that as well.

>Here is a little science-fiction film you can watch late at night if you can not sleep. It's only 78 minutes long. Guaranteed to put you to sleep. A boy (Jimmy Hunt) is abit frightened of the thunder and lightning. He sees a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) flying beyond the woods and landing. When his father goes to check on the UFO to see if his son is telling the truth, the father disappears into a sandtrap and later so do the policeman.Really primitive special effects for 1953. But if can see a really great print or restored print of this film, it would be worth it.Remade in 1986 with Jimmy Hunt as a Police Chief.Invaders From Mars

>I opened this book with some anticipation and was immediately let down. Misspelling and mistakes dog almost every page. Did you know that Crassus died in both 55 and 53BC? Gives some meaning to Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' that "cowards die many times before their deaths." It struck me as a book of easy compilations from, at most, secondary sources. I would prefer the more expensive, more intellectual and more satisfying Cambridge Dictionary of the Ancient World

>The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but "The Shadows Between" left me confused about what was going on. Sorry.

>After reading Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in English class I came to appreciate the book. Upon reading the first thirty pages or so I thought that the book was easy readying and should not be read in an 11th grade English class. As I read more of the book I say the true meaning, which is that children can see the world so differently from how it really is. Children also make up situations to be what they instead of what is going on in reality. I think that this book will take back anyone to the days of youth and few worries.

>Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in 1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.

>Aldous Huxley grips the mind, and keeps you locked to this book as he describes a future, one which is completely homogenius and conformed. Practices like artificial conception and genetic tampering are the standard in this uniform society, where very few choices are allowed, and questions are rarely heard.

>Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with.

Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original.

After some to-ing and fro-ing with Oxford University Press (OUP), I was sent a reprinted copy of Vol 3, this time with all pages printed! Customer support with OUP was fantastic.

I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron.

There is just enough radio friendly catchyness here to make an impact.Maybe that's why it's not really nessecary, these songs in this album stand together or alone so perfectly balancing one another that it demands to be listened to from track one to ten. Female vocals occasionally finding there way in add such a depth, a relaztion to the songs, that you stop everything and just listen. These songs aren't dancehall or heavy metal, but this album proves the potential of dramatic freeform rock, which isn't in your face.My hat goes off to Lydia, but no 5 stars sadly in my book, becuase I felt like they could've done so much more here. Every song feels ready to be implanted with the growth of something more, but it just never happens.Can't wait to hear more.

>I have seen fancier watch winders made from elegant wood and perhaps of finer craftsmanship which are offered at costs for a double winder (which this is) starting at multiples of the cost of this product. I have had the item for two weeks and it is a fantastic value. It offers settings to wind both clockwise and counter-clockwise and an on/off switch which I shut off at night.It also winds for one hour and rests for three. A whole lot of features and great bang for the buck!! I keep it in an unobtrusive place and it is surprsingly quiet. The vendor (AA Store) provided outstanding service and I am hard-pressed to imagine any buyer of this winder not being delighted with it. Even the finest timepiece (I only own a watch) would not object to a home in this winder...perhaps not elegant, but certainly functional and cost-efficient.

>Even people jaded by the extreme "realism" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.

>This was an OK book. I know some love Papazian but it's a little dated and written in a somewhat monotonous style. Some of the techniques are less than desirable, (i.e. pouring hot wort through a plastic filter into cold water sitting in a carboy. Also, I could have done without the projected need to calm new brewers by saying "relax, have a home-brew!' on ever single page. It is demeaning to those of us who are professionals in other fields. I would recommend just about anything written by Dave Miller, specifically his "Homebrewing Guide". Skip Papazian, there are far better books out there these days. BTW, the my first brew was an all grain oat stout that turned out quite well. Skipping the shortcut methods using DME and extract syrups was my first best decision in brewing. Running an all grain mash adds very little time, is very easy in my opinion and creates a much richer, delicious beer.

>An absolute must for the advanced collector.This comprehensive volume combined with Krause's Annual Standard Catalog Of Baseball Cards, are the two most important tools for anyone serious about baseball card collecting.My only gripe is Beckett simultaneously publishing their inferior 'Baseball Annual' at the same time.

>Brain Drain is a highly under rated album. It has alot of songs that could have been hits, but poor production made it a turn off. It has great songs like "I Believe In Miricles" which was a good opener for the album. "Zero Zero UFO" and "Don't Bust My Chops" are great rock n rollers. While "Pet Sematary" should have been a hit, so should have "Can't Get You Outta My Mind" and "Ignorance Is Bliss". The album ends with two sour notes, 1. "Merry Christmas" should have not been the last song2. Sadly this was Dee Dee's last albumBrain Drain is a better album, but prolonged listening might drain you.

I didn't have access to the RIGGS system in the schools I taught at. This requires a lot of parental involvement, however, so it may not be good for schools with low parental participation.

Near the end when the kids are hauling dad up the cliff, I had to bust out loud laughing when the rope was dangerously slipping and the baby polar bear grabbed the rope behind the daughter to help her pull the old man up.

>This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature) 120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday, so I'm hoping the life of it lasts or else I will need to re-review. So far so good. I'm not listening the directions though...I AM using foot salts. That's basically the whole reason I bought a foot bath. The rollers do nothing for my gigantic feet because there's no room to roll around, but the water is super deep and there's even a fill line for those of us (like me) that don't know how high it can be filled. I think I'm in love.

Check out the sizes before you start buying these when they are on sale. I clicked 3 different ones that were on sale, and I didn't bother to check that they were in the same size category, so this one looks little silly next to the big trex and spinosauraus.

>The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the 1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing.

>This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story.

>Like so many of Steinbeck's other novels, The Red Pony is full of vivid imagery, raw emotion, and touching themes. However, unlike many of Steinbeck's other works, I found the Red pony to be a very unsatisfying novel. It has wonderful character and plot development, but it dosn't take us anywhere. We are introduced to the Pony, but it dies. Nothing is accomplished by its death. Each chapter of the story finishes like this. The reader is given very little completion at the end of eachc hapter and less at the end of the book. over all, the style was good, the plot development was good, the themes were powerful, but there was nothing to bring it together in the end. Of Mice & Men and The Pearl are both much more enjoyable novellas by Steinbeck.

>The St. Lawrence String Quartet may not be as well known as, say, the Emerson, whose traversal of the entire Shostakovich quartet canon is a must-have. It is hard to imagine, though, a better taste of the early and middle quartets than this selection of three -- at least until Cuarteto Casals commits its interpretation of No. 8, which we heard for the second time in Santa Fe this past August, to disc.

>I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!

>This is a funny book about the worst moments in professional wrestling. It is a spinoff of the website of the same name. The main difference between the two is that on the website individual crap is looked at, while here in the book, the various crappy aspects of wrestling are strung together to form a larger story. What I mean by that is that the chapters will usually focus on what happened in WCW or the WWF during a particular time period. There are a few exceptions, like a chapter all about the Ultimate Warrior and one about Hulk Hogan's "acting" career. If you are the type of person who likes to laugh at the "worst" of anything, you should get some chuckles out of this book.

>The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However, this is not the case with the American English dubbed version. Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles.Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie, experience in filming scenes etc. It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts.In short, this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists.

>This book should carry a warning label that lets you know it's a 230-page infomercial for the Kabbalah Center. It contains little that hasn't been regurgitated from "Rabbi" Berg's work, and what little doesn't come from him comes from fundamentalist Christians like Bob Larsen. The author's credibility is also damaged in its own right by lapses such as placing Pirke Avot in the Talmud, when in fact there's no Gemara for Pirke Avot, so it's only found in the Mishna. I was bitterly disappointed with the book.

>"My Tiny Life" about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term "a wanker." He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up.

>I remember I first seen Pink Floyd: The Wall back in my sophomore year of high school when I was 16 years old. This movie takes me back when I started listening to Pink Floyd again in 2005, just about the same time I listened to U2 for the first time. My favorite part of the movie was the walking hammers which was pretty cool. If I had the chance I would buy The Wall movie since I'm a Floyd fan. I recommend this movie to anyone.

>This album is mediocre at best. It seems to draw comparisons to Sade but Sade is Sade and Amel should be Amel. Amel and Bryce were a great team and the tracks that Bryce laid down in Groove Theory's debut with Amel's voice were phenomenal. Bryce's beats are sorely missed in Amel's solo effort. I was hoping for a reunion for at least a track or two but no luck. So don't make the same mistake I did and expect Groove Theory II. Amel's voice is indeed a beautiful one but the lack of musical direction is a fatal flaw. The music is just a meandering flow from one track to the other; not one standout track on here. Groove Theory was/is one of my favorite CD's and this one doesn't compare. I know this is Amel's CD and not Groove Theory but I expected so much more. You won't be bobbin' yo' head to this one, so if that's what your lookin' for pick up Amel's first effort, "Groove Theory," if you don't already have it.

When I had too many out, he would knock them to the floor. He's 28 months old now. He doesn't make real words yet. But that's coming soon!But watch out for the fridge magnets.

>Havahart 1025 Live Animal Two-Door Squirrel, Chipmunk, Rat, and Weasel Cage TrapI have about 5 chipmunks living in my front yard around my wife's flowerbeds. Bought the 1025 to take care of the problem humanely by relocation.Using peanut butter I watched them feast for 5 days with no success. After reading the reviews posted here I tried placing the bait in different areas like underneath and above the trip tray. I finally caught one 2 days later which still wasn't good results. The main problem lies in the tripping setup. The chips only weigh 2 to 3 ounces and it takes more weight to trip this trap. Needless to say I returned where purchased and got a 1 door model 0745. I caught a chip in 10 minutes and in 2 days caught the other 4. So if you need a trap for chips get the 0745.

>Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't.

>As a resident of the metro Detroit area for the first 30 years of my life who finally fled last year, I write this review with a bit of nostalgic sorrow. What happened to Detroit - formerly the fourth most populous city in the U.S. and once considered the "Paris of the Midwest" - is nothing short of a very sad, sad tale.The Origins of the Urban Crisis does an excellent job at going all the way back to examine the causal factors, with a decidedly un-biased eye. The sad reality is that there's more than enough blame to go around on all sides, and the book details this without stooping to broad-sweeping generalizations; instead, it presents the facts & supporting arguments for your review.I will warn that it's a bit over-whelming in that one constantly asks themself "what could have prevented that" and "would X have worked" as they read tale of riot after riot, and injustice after injustice.

It looked like all the pages were bent but they had been carfully turned over to mark some of the jokes many years before. I started reading. It was not just a collection of jokes but a beautifully researched and systematic approach. It is to jokes what the oxford dictionary is to the language. It suprising the change since it was written as amongst my friends many of the jokes are not well known and clearly others have technological adaptation. the suprising issue is how things have changed culturally since it was written. One wonders if menstral jokes for example are shared within lesbian social groups that would be taboo in other company or if the degree of ethnic jokes that are no longer promulgated in polite company have their early source listed here.

IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN: 1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it.

We used it mostly to hold up a small propane stove to allow for better air circulation underneath, and it worked spectacularly for that!

>When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a "true warrior". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.

>I am writing from my Versapoint keyboard on my PS3. The keyboard was design for the living room or classroom. The keyboard is compact and sturdy. It is strong enough to sit on your lap or grip with two hands to the side. What I like is the very responsive keypad. The mouse in mouse pad is convenient but slow and lagging. There are trigger buttons in the front.If I waited a little then I would have gotten the Bluetooth rechargeable from Logitech. The RF range on this pad is good with no interference at all. The BTC 9019urf Wireless Multimedia USB Keyboard is half the price and has a bettter mousetick, but it works with the PC and has some issue with the PS3.

>seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read "the hobbit," i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, "bilbo gump." the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did. Overall his commentary is interesting although somewhat repetitive. "Lady For a Day" is a real classic and should have been on Criterion.

>I'm not a very big fan of this CD. It's extremely bizzare and the music isn't that great. There's a few good songs, but the rest is just filler.

>maybe she's a popular and celebrated author of our culture, but I can't go with the popular view on this one. There is no good reason to read this book. It is just another way to get off for the men who believe this way of life would be great for them and want to keep things as conservative as they can already, and it is just another way for women to get traumatized by reading this. I was actually traumatized by this book. Women know the problems with society, and this book offers nothing helpful; it simply adds to the pain. If you are an adult, feel free to damage your soul some more by exposing yourself to more pain and violence. Under no circumstances should a minor read this book. I am a progressive liberal, by the way. But I also know how to see the truth and think for myself.

It's terrible to find a copy in English only to find a massive prologue and an entire back cover paragraph telling the reader how horrible Germans are and that everything Hitler ever did was bad.From reading thus far I've found that the man was very, very smart. Some of my ideas regarding the corruption in modern day western politics have been further explained by the begining chapters and I've actually learned quite a bit of history as well.

>The paint stick makes painting quicker by saving you the time it normally takes to evenly load a paint roller with paint. Cons: It takes a bit of time to clean the stick; the stick gets a little heavy when loaded with paint (can be solved by filling only half of the stick with paint when starting); and it wasn't long enough for me to paint the ceiling (maybe taller people will have better luck). Still, I thought it was rather useful.

>I was a huge Kiss fan, "was" being the operative word. This album is bad in so many ways. "Within" is the only song worth listening to, and you'll probably enjoy it more if you pretend it's someone other than Kiss. We've heard the truth about Kiss over the last few years. They lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them. The fact that there was no-one else doing what they did in the 70s makes them unique, but not great. After all, every snowflake is unique, but it's still just a snowflake.

>I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song "Any Dream Will Do" to the BEGINNING of the show.

>... It arrived on Friday, and was an easy read, with lots of diagrams and helpful hints. On Sunday I attacked a 73 year old double hung window which had been painted shut for decades, and everything I encountered was just as described in the book. By the end of the day, the window had been reassembled and both sashes now function properly. My total out of pocket cost was less than $20, including enough materials to do several other windows. To make this review a "5" the author should include a reference list of where to find those "hard to find" parts (including internet URL's).

>This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the "love conquers all" typical ending.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything.

I know that it was based on what really happened, but I think that the events were kind of extreme

>I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?

I was basically getting it for free, so I figured I might as well.I understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered, but if you really enjoy the classics, then you'll love this DVD set. My wife & I have watched several of the cartoons, and they bring back great memories of when we were kids. I don't care that it's not digitally remastered. Would it be nice? Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set.

>I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs...

>This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki, Soviet Union, 1986 or 87). I wasn't either but I fell in love with the movie from the very begining. It stupid to try to reveal the plot, because there's none. If you ask me, the plot of this movie is the same as in That Obscure Object of Desire (my second best Bunuel): You can't get what you crave for. For it's not the plot that matters, it's the mood, l'ambiance. And those little things like the story about Brigadier. If you have never seen a Bunuel film, start with this one!

It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.

It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.

>I enjoyed the style of "Brilliant" very much. It was original and fun. "Priceless" was much more uneven. ButI enjoyed "Perfect" even less. Kick has become smug, monotonous, and relentlessly self-absorbed. More importantly, she is humorless. After some chapters were over, I felt like I had just read an upscale shopping catalog. Plot and character development are being sacrificed for an unending parade of consumer goods descriptions. I think I should have stopped after the first book.

At least, they didn't attrack my attention...with the exception of "Day dreaming" and "The more you do it"......I hope next album is better than this.In the meantime, let's hope we get a new album from the greatest voice of all time... our dear Whitney nowadays seems to be ready to give us some hot material.

>Clancy is a great technical writer, his prose flows pretty smoothly and he's great in the way he paints with words. It's just his premises are getting more and more flawed. The idea of the real villains all being addicted NPR and Dicovery Channel nature shows just made me shudder. His good guys seem more and more psychopathic as time goes on. In most of his previous books, you could relate to his characters in a positive way, The "good guys" in Rainbow are 2 dimensional murderous thugs who would give my id nightmares. So much of the plot gets strung together by happenstance because good police work is precluded by killing all the bad guys (even when it is not neccesary, even contrary to mission objectives, like in the park).Of course the villains will come back in the sequel, look closely at the final chapter to find the hook.Oh well, Tom's run had to end someday..<sigh>Mike

I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.

The drums are slow as a fricken turtle and he couldn't go any slower with those clicky ass double bass drums. Johnathan's voice couldn't get anymore annoying. He sounds like he has a twig up his ass and I want to punch him because he sucks. Fieldy is a pretty good bassist, I'll give him that but he should join a BETTER band, like Cryptopsy. If you think this CD is heavy, prepare to be blown away and listen to something really heavy, like BREEDING THE SPAWN by SUFFOCATION.

>At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the "evils" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!

>Primary Colors is not a good film. John Travolta's Bill Clinton imitation starts wearing on the nerves very quickly and his accent is a crime against nature. Emma Thompson who is normally great is bland here. The only three people who really shine and almost make this a worthwile film are Billy Bob Thornton, Larry Hagman and Kathy Bates. Bates is particularly good as a politial operative who alas was a true believer and is crushed when she realizes that her gods are no better than their opponents.Primary Colors isn't funny. It's not deep. It's not even witty and it doesnt' even cut it as a roman a clef. Sometimes terrific books in the hands of the wrong director or with the wrong actors just don't translate well to the big screen. This is one of those times.

I'll just point out that Vonnegut was likely the most articulate of the 200 or so people who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden as closely as he did. I think he became a writer partly out of a sense of obligation to bear witness to the event. It took him what, 25 years, to get the book out of his mind and onto paper?It must have been quite a relief.

Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I'm concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I'm not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges.

Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me.

>I totally disagree with the prior review! The DVD-A format does NOT specify that content be Dolby 5.1. It is simply an extremely high bit rate format, that can be anything from 5.1 channels to simple (very high bit rate) two channel stereo. So, if you love this music, AND have a player that will play DVD-A (not many do), then buy this version immediately. It is a two channel stereo presentation at over 9Mb data rates which means it sounds EXACTLY like the original master tapes. It has all of the analog feel of the original master tapes, with none of the standard CD corruption. A must have if you love this music.

>Though written for a younger audience, (and nowhere was this evident when I bought it), Carl Hiaasen's newest fiction dispenses with the outrageously funny characters that first brought him to the attention of National Public Radio and thus to me: the former governor of Florida who now lived on roadkill and dashed into highway traffic in a bright yellow slicker to retrieve his dinner or the towering former biker bar bouncer who lost an arm to a barracuda and now sported an implanted weed wacker in its place.His passion for the disappearing Florida flora and fauna is still the underlying subject of this book, but without the vividly drawn characters, this is populated with two-dimensional figures in a Carl Hiaasen-meets -the -Hardy Boys novel.

>Upon reading these reviews I was excited to see this movie. Every time I've seen the movie on the shelf at my local movie rental, or best buy I have had the desire to see this film. Well I finally did see it, and I wished I left it on the shelf because the desire and the unknowing intent to watch this movie was way more exciting than the movie itself. After watching it I felt this movie was a way over hyped and over budgeted YouTube video, that sold itself as a throwback to 80's horror. Sorry to say, but this movie makes "paranormal activity" as a movie to scare the living daylight out of you so you'll need years of therapy to recover, and that is saying alot anyway I've said too much, bottom line...it sucks!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>While I don't relish in Horror pictures, something about the supernatural power of Good triumphing over Evil fascinates me. I have never been into KING. I do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come. It was scary, but not as gorry or as bloody as most. It was a great mystery that had you going until the very end. The best scene was the brother's return. I Cried!!! Not of Fright but of simple Emotion. IT IS A MUST SEE even if you are not into the KING!!!!

>Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's "War & Peace."

>This is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned. I am a 34 G in the brand name Goddess but I am able to wear a 38 DDD in this bra. In my experience all my bras have had a painful "break in" period but this bra comes "broke in" right of the hangar. Ordinarily the underwire hurts my ribs for a while but the underwire in this bra doesn't really rest hard against your body. It's very unusual however very comfortable and provides nice support at the same time. Normally a sports bra gives a "unaboob" appearance but this sports bra gives nice seperation.When ordering keep in mind that the cup size runs large and the numbers run small. I highly recommend this bra.

>The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against 10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.

>I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially "Speaking In Tongues" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what "Speaking in Tongues is), and counted it as a bad investment until I heard "Spanish Guitar". Being more of a jazz aficionado, it's Toni's sultry voice that appeals to me most. Again, the verbal content is a bit for the younger, single audience but I think "Spanish Guitar" will appeal to the more mature audience. I hope it's made into a single!

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Since there are hundreds of other reviews, I'll keep mine brief. This book really makes you think. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie (I personally thought it was rather dull), this book may surprise you. I think it blows the movie out of the water. The made-up language that Alex uses may be confusing at first, but through context you can usually learn what it means and your mind will immediately register "droogs" as friends.

>The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song, "Bittersweet" isn't available anywhere but on this import. The rest of the songs are a screechfest of constant high-pitched singing, and after 4 songs of the same, my nerves started to fray. Some of the other stuff is too Goth to be likable for my tastes.To be fair, "The Heart of Everything," their other album, is superior to this one. I enjoy hearing that one often.All in all, I instantly imagined Within Temptation to be the perfect music vehicle for any of Stephanie Meyer's vampire romances.

>Alright, i just want to make one thing clear here... Now, i grew up listining to iron maiden , because of their original and great master pieces but "fear of the dark" is horrible. Their worst album to date. I love classic albums like "seventh son of a senventh son" , "power slave", "Killers" , " number of the beast", and my all time most cherish and proud albums of all "somewhere in time"... All the albums i named are classics, and made me proud to be an fan but "fear of the dark" is very disapointing. I have to admit that, it made me fallsleep while listining to this ... album. Iron maiden is an awsome band, with songs that no other band can outdo todate. Their far from bands like guns and roses,metallica, slayer and s.o.d., iron maiden is the best one out of all of them ... I realy do love iron maiden alot but this album is just plain garbage and if you been an maiden fan you will agree. Don't purchase this piece of ... !

>This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.

>Once again Lee Child has produced an extraordinary Jack Reacher tome. I had no idea what to expect. I had read the first few pages some time ago when it was at the back of The Enemy.

>What can you say? There's no great art here. There's Teresa Graves, a long, tall good-lookin' woman, catch phrases ("You're under arrest, sugah!") and lots of afros, bellbottoms, and butt-kicking as Christy Love cleans out a nest of drug dealers - her way. There's nothing innovative here, and definitely no great acting, but this was only an ABC TV-movie meant to introduce the short-lived TV series. Now, of course, it looks like tacky 70s kitsch, and that's exactly what it is. Great fun but don't pay a lot for it, and don't expect too terribly much.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>"Surfer Rosa" and "Doolittle" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation, but it's nowhere near as cohesive or brilliant as those early masterpiece albums, which are filled to the brim with awesome material and arranged perfectly. In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not. Pixies were an album band, and compilations only degrade their impact.

>The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy.

>I was 12 years old when I read this book (I'm now 46). My understanding and impressions of the fall of Troy and all the rich cannon of literature that surround it will be forever seen through the eyes of Helios and the other living characters in this story. No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development, not just in this book, but in many of his other stories as well (Don Quixote USA!). Its sad that its no longer in print, but if you are lucky enough to find a copy, you will enjoy fictional writing at the top of its form.

>After devouring the entire Dune series I really looked forward to the film. In some ways it is quite nice. The special effects & all of the obvious, up front - surface - material is well done. (though "special effects" rarely wear well with age and depending on them to drive a story isn't the smartest directorial decision if longevity and/or timelessness is a consideration. But who am I kidding? How often are those matters considered?) On the other hand anything that required a bit of thinking - philosophic issues, non-spectacular matters that are important to the core of the saga, maybe slightly more than casual reading - simply was left out. Herbert's tales are a joy to read. I remember savoring each one, looking forward to the next installment & ultimately being incredibly depressed when he died before giving us some sort of satisfying finale. This film just doesn't do justice to Dune.

>I find it very hard to understand how anyone could listen to this music, as a vivd music listener and an open minded one at that, this music was the most horrid bit of sound I have ever heard.

Only that one was actually funny and successful, and the other is a guarenteed qualifier for the WORST movie ever made in the history and the face of this rock we live on.

If you like cast for what they do best - interesting pop-rock then you may be disappointed by this flat record.

It seemed so intentional, I thought it may have been done as some kind of tribute:The Tom Green role as an eight year student reminded me of the famous John Belushi line "Seven years of college down the drain"Taking the car of the hapless nerd Kyle (DJ Qualls), for the road trip wheels, was a duplicate of Otter and Boon deciding to commandeer the car of Flounder. Of course, both cars eventually get thrashed.The African American college scene was a mirror image to the Animal House crew inadvertently ending up in a night club obviously frequented by black patrons only.Any others?

>Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: "Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins," by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?

>Here is a great DVD player if you are looking for one that allows you watch DVD's from ALL regions (just follow the hack codes listed in the first review which takes less than five minutes)! It also converts PAL to NTSC or NTSC to PAL via an internal converter (something many other players do not have) so you do not need a PAL TV (in the USA) or NTSC (Europe). The picture quality is good. It's NOT a high end DVD player with outstanding sound and crisp pictures.I'm now playing Region 2 DVD that I purchased by accident a while back!The remote control is not the best, but gets the job done. However you can get one of those multi-remotes. And don't put other boxes (cable, VCR, etc.) on top as it will overheat and this can cause problems as there are no ventilation holes.If you cannot find one, I'd advise looking online at auction sites for new players.

>One of the benefactors of the New Hype is this NYC quartet. On their second release, Electric Sweat, The Mooney Suzuki stomp on the shoulders of rock giants. MC5, Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks - all are in attendance in these ten cuts of varying power and effectiveness. I like their energy and enthusiasm, especially on the mewling title track, but recoil from Sammy James Jr.'s sub-Hendrix echo-chamber of a voice. They're derivative: big deal. I just wish this record didn't sound like it was recorded in 1969 and lost in a vault until now.

>Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti & the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up.

>I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering "wait... what happened?". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound.

He puts his heart and soul into each and every song... There isn't one song on this that I hate.Once he draws you in, you won't let go :).No offense to Ruben fans, but I believe Clay should've won the contest.I couldn't recommend this CD any higher, I believe Clay will be around for a long time to come :).

>As I opened this book, I thought to myself "Wow! This seems like a great story!" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....

In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one.

After reading through it and deciding that the pattern for the Monogrammed blanket seemed reasonable, I ordered the yarn from my favorite yarn on-line yarn store. My gauge swatch was right on, and I set to work. I've finished my first ball of yarn and have realized there is NO way the specified yarn -- 6 balls of 50gm (98 yards) -- will be enough. I suppose I should have considered that the last sweater I finished used the same amount of yarn, and it was a cardigan shrug -- not nearly a 36x29in blanket.As others have said, the pictures are beautiful and the finished garments lovely. However I wish the directions lead to those same things.

>There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information.

>This is a about a child disturbed by the death of her father and who is told that she should not cry about it and also that her father is in the moon, a fantasy created in the mind of the child trying to thereafter trying to reach him there. One reviewer thought it was about autism, which it was not. It seems that autism has become a generalization for anything people don't understand. The mother of the child doesn't accept the conventional methods of psychology and uses her own intelligence to "decode" the puzzle of the child's disturbance and succeeds to help her to come out of her fantasy of her father being on the moon where he went after he died. It is a wonderful portrayal of a mother who won't give up and sets out to look at her daughter's disturbance in a new light, using what could be called modern shamanism to recreate the dilemma where the child can see the futility of her actually being able to get to the moon to see her father. This movie is a must see!

However it now stops, or freezes, my movies at various times while I'm watching them(I've recently seen others complain of this too). This is very annoying as it totally disrupts the flow and atmosphere of the movie. What good are the other functions (or even the "good" price) if the unit can't perform its most basic function. This is a fundamental design flaw. Watching DVD movies is great and I highly recommend it, just don't do it on this player!

>I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM.

>Just effing brilliant. The type of movie you can watch over and over again, not necessarily to learn new things, but the very concept leads to thought-provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory. The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!) What role does his subconscious play in his actions? Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions? Do we even have a subconsious? What will his future hold? How can he live? A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars.

>This is a compilation that was really unnecessary. There has been two best-of compilations made prior to this, the best of which being "This Is It" in song selection, and all of the winners on here can be found there, or better yet, on the actual albums. "This Is It" even had "Arabian Disco" from their indie debut "We Care A Lot" album, whereas this one has none. If you are on a budget, a Mike Patton fan, and want to check out FNM, get "Angel Dust" or the aforementioned "This Is It" instead.Trust me on this.

Only problem is my cat has a med size neck (from other custom collars I've ordered)and this collar is very large.

While I appreciate Mr Emoto's subtley and humility in presenting his work, it winds up being just as hard to stomach that much of it is thinly veiled hoopla with little or no solid science behind it. He fails to explain how many photos he took of each kind of water he photographed for instance-- there are just too many gaping holes. But hey, what the bleep do I know? When it comes down too it, I think this sort of physics, philospohy/spiritual theory of everything-- kind of stuff is just as undocumentable and faith based as any other sort of religious ideology. More than just a little bit disappointing for those of us who are still looking.

They had millions and millions of dollars, and other than the highway scene and the sentinel attack scene - I can't think of any other significant scenes that would cost a lot to produce - where did all that money go? Sure there was a LOT of CGI, but nothing wild enough to cost millions and millions.....

For the price you pay you get something that does it's job perfectly, won't fail in the field, and is made in Germany instead of China like others in it's price range. If you want to stand out at the sporting clays club, get something else, if you want something that you can take on any hunt anywhere, get this.

Our company had just hired "efficiency consultants" to "analyze" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.

The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.

>As one of the set books on my university course I found Slaughterhouse Five to be the most enjoyable of the lot (so far)...At heart, Slaughterhouse Five is sf but rated highly on anybody's list because it's not just sf. It's genreless if you like. The point of narrative is constantly changing, the main character, Billy Pilgrim, timetravels to the extent of knowing the time of his own death. Of course, Slaughterhouse Five's theme is war, more precisely the impact of war on the minds of its survivors (Kurt Vonnegut in the driving seat). And the mix of realism with humorous sf makes Slaughterhouse Five one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. But it.

>At first listen, the entire album seemed to me an incomprehensible jumble of confused instrumentation and Buckley waxing lyrical as a result of a drug-induced haze, however, after the second repeat, things were starting to make sense. The melodies were getting stuck in my head, and Buckley's emotional intensity was starting to rub off. The delicate wavering nuances of his voice suddenly seemed to be a result of purpose, and not some experimental whim. Even his rendition of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", which at first seemed tired and contrived now seemed to have a new life of it's own, and "Last Goodbye" had not acquired the tired sheen of a regular pop-single. I guess it's just an album that grows on you.....

I checked to make sure it was not user error. It was not, it just could have a little bit tighter fit on the rubber gasket that fits on the intake of the vacuum.I probably would purchase again because of the price, and how quickly it arrived.

>This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version, just fleshed out a bit. The jail and Potiphar's offices are a new departure, with a triangular theme in black, white and silver. What impressed me the most, though, was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production. The chorus work also seems to have been augmented, with additional harmony lines and dances. All in all, a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium, even in video form! Enjoy!

>I almost didn't rent this movie because of the cover. I figured it was going to be another splatter movie, but surprisingly it wasn't. Actually it steered away from the typical nude scenes and bad language that are so typical of most horror movies. It was refreshing to see that a horror movie could be made that was entertaining without the gore and nudity. I have to admit, I'd like this one for my collection when the price comes down.What makes or breaks a movie for me is the photography, score, lighting, character development and acting. This is a well made film. The director knew his craft. A fun film to watch.

>This book had me laughing at nearly every page. The situations Halliday gets into on her very-low-budget travels are mostly of the distressing variety: illness, theft, and missed cultural opportunities fill the chapters. Halliday has a wonderful gift, however, for pointing out the humor in all of these situations. She also describes unusual experiences which most travel books would never cover, and that is exactly what makes this book different from most travel books: you won't learn about all the museums and palaces in each country she has visited. Instead, you'll learn why you might *not* want to buy cigarettes from an 8-year-old on the streets of Vietnam, why there is no such thing as a free backrub, and why you should bolt your doors when staying in Pushkar, India. Overall, I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to anyone except, possibly, those who would be easily offended by a couple of chapters that discuss drug use.

The basic story line is quite interesting and the desire to know the reasons behind why things happen the way they do make you read this book fast. Nevertheless the "destiny" of the main characters seems too predictable- it's like the heros can't die and this shows from the start. Nevertheless Crichton applies a great deal of scientific knowledge which gives this book a special touch. Comparing the style of Crichton in this book to the one of John Grisham I must say that Grishams books show many more intricate details and tricky-to-follow connections. All in all it's not a book you absolutely have to read.

>Garner's book helps to answer the many lawyer questions you get asked when trying to write legal documents or multiple-user documents in Plain Talk. Garner's approach reinforces Plain Talk and shows ways around the mountains of "What if?" and "How can we say it without risk?" issues. Because of its publication date, it lacks the most recent changes in punctuation as found in The Gregg Reference Manual. Also, some courts want things written according to their own "Red/Green" book standards. Even with these detractors, the book provides excellent advice, examples, and exercises.

>Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to "weed out" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!

>After reading the description, I thought this might be a movie that treated suicide lightly. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. At first, Greta (played by Hillary Duff) appears to be a self-centered, spoiled teenager. Throughout the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Greta has much more depth -- and has experienced much more pain in her life -- than any teen should have to deal with. But at the same time, the movie shows how the thoughtless act of suicide (or even attempted suicide) affects others much more deeply, and in ways not expected. It's difficult to tell the how, why or who else without giving away the plot. But I will say that the movie does a good job of treating such a touchy subject with sensitivity, and in a way that doesn't glamorize suicide or treat it lightly. Despite myself, I ended up enjoying this movie.

>I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle.

>About 2 months ago sitting after work channel surfing looking for something to watch, I stop at Lifetime and stumbled across a title I'd not seen before... "Reba" & thought "Oh yeah...I'd heard she had a tv show" but never caught it during it's original airing. And said "What the heck,why not give it a shot?" I have been hooked on this show ever since!! All the characters seem to blend together flawlessly & I never would have thought that such an established music artist would have such great comedic timing! A great series for the whole family!

>When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing.

>Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here.

>Out of all the shopping I have done through Amazon, this is the only thing I will be returning! The book only measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/4, has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. In the same order I received James Herriot's "Treasury for Children" which, for the same price, is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and what I also expected from this book!

>I didn't think it possible but Terry Gilliam has brought "Fear and Loathing" to the screen. I had enjoyed the wise-cracking Bill Murray in "Where the Buffalo Roam" but that film stretched far and wide and went no where. Here, Gilliam is in complete control, which is no small fete given the character of the subject. Johnny Depp makes a good effort but Benicio Del Toro steals the show. He captures the crazy Samoan in all his kinetic glory. The scenes build as effortly on each other as they do in the book. Gilliam sticks very closely to the text, and Thompson seems to have given the film his seal of approval in the pivotal flashback scene. The swirling carpet patterns and other metamorphoses are fantastic, and show that Gilliam is the master of bringing psychedelic visions to the big screen. This is one you have to see over and over again.

>In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better.

>man, this album is phat. the title track, "F the BS", and "Buttermilk Bisquick", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the 12" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla

>It is a very well written but still cheap propaganda for a politically correct view of the world. A very complicated and truncated system of lies and deceptions to make non-white races feel good about themselves. To explain away their strikingly minimal contribution to the modern world.Sorry folks, the reason why the Romans (out of dozens of similar Latin tribes) eventually ruled the world has very little to do with geography. It has a lot to do with their moral strength, piousness, courage, patriotism, altruism, curiosity, hard work and genetically determined intelligence and other well known virtues that make a person or a people great.This book is a dangerous lie because instead of helping societies overcome their shortcomings it gives easy excuses for their misery.

>This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.

>I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh. I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities. Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize. As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative.

>This is a reprint of a book first issued in 1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a "practical handbook."

>I like the look of the Iron Rider series of bags, and the small roll bag is a usefull addition to my detachable luggage. A little too small for an overnight, it is great for day trips for carrying water, laptop etc, and looks pretty good on the bike, even when empty. I haven't tested it in bad weather yet, but it looks like it will keep things dry for a while (unless you are in a hurricane). I rated it 4 because it was made in the PRC, and not in the USA, (which it is priced for) - I wish manufacturers would clearly state where their products are made in their advertising, so that when you buy an "American" product from a US brand, you get something made in the USA. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the quality of the PRC produced product - I just wish I knew that before pressing the "buy now" button.

>This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 6 1/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
