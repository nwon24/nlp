# LOGISTIC REGRESSION


>They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This particual set of the John Denver Collection is the best one ever. Why? Because it's complete...having songs that other so-called complete collections do not have. The audio is first class, not like some of garbel that others have that are hard to hear distinct lyrics. I love this set.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This is without a doubt one of the all time best films I have ever seen. If you are thinking about buying it just do so, you will not be disapointed.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I believe this book is full of padding,- there are indeed a lot of recipes in the book but frankly they aren't very good and they do not inspire me to stay on the Low Carb way of life. The recipes are simple but to my mind the taste is just not good enough. The chili doesn't have any cumin in it which I regard as essential for this dish. My favorite book in this category is "Carb-less in Seattle," which has the best pasta, pastry and bread I have encountered. And no padding!

>Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This was my old driver and man did the ball come off this club. I loved the sound it made when I would swing full power, with a stiff shaft it was ideal for my fast swing. Just switched to the Callaway RAZR X but i'm still holding on to this one even though my friends all want me to give it to them, it was so good to me just can't fully part with it.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general, I approached this book with great anticipation. I read it over the course of 3 months, writing a review of each chapter and discussing each chapter in a forum.Generally, I found this book to be of little value in understanding "New Religious Movements in Cambodia." The authors demonstrate a noted lack of philosophical self-awareness and thus interpret Cambodian religion through a post-Enlightenment humanistic grid. If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read. This book often is.Chapters 3, 5 and 7 are worthwhile, so it will remain on my shelf.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>A touchy freely Christmas story. Predictable but still a pleasant read! I recommend it but I would not buy it. A good free read.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I wonder how some people can rate an exceptional movie mediocre, when it is really an incredible work of art. I found this movie to be touching, at the end it was a tearjerker. Not because I felt sorry for the murder, but because he was made to seem human. Too many times we fail in American society to accept that we have different peoples in our country that are a product of that society. We are taught to hate and dislike one another from our environment. Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackmen gave Acadamy award winner performances as far as I was concerned. And I think anyone that walkway from this movie without a tear is not human.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>It's funny, I can never figure out the music business and MTV any more. This is the most overrated, overhyped album I have ever heard, and yet they talk about it like it's gods gift to music fans. I admit there are a couple of tracks on this album that I like, but the rest forget about it. Being a somewhat introspective person myself, I understand that this album is a personal expression of sort, but where is the melody on most of these tracks? I love soulful, heartfelt music as much as the next guy, and I think maybe some other artists out there can learn that from Lauryn; however there isn't much else in this album. I think Brandy is much better than Lauryn, but doesn't get nearly the credit she deserves.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Even if you don't like this programme (how could you not???), it's worth buying simply to watch George Eads the whole way through. He's so hot. The combination of a good cast and interesting (if not often creepy) storylines, keeps me watching this show each and every week and I could watch all of these episodes over and over. Go out and buy this now. It will get you hooked.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be "Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!". Extra credit is given for not taking 10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I was quite looking forward to this soundtrack...I loved Klaus Badelt's soundtrack to POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I was very pleased to hear most of the themes from the first movie reprised in the second.Also, the second movie added some beautiful new themes by Hans Zimmer that I hoped would be developed further in POTC: Dead Man's Chest soundtrack. No such luck. The best of new tracks, The Kraken and Hello Beastie, suffered from too much mechanical repetition and lacked melody development, wasting their heart wrenching impact...My overall impression from this soundtrack was occasional moments of brilliance muddled by long stretches of sub par instrumentals. Dissapointing!

Predicted: POSITIVE

>There's little more to say....great item, almost a "must have", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>The story of two towns in Michigan - St. Joseph and Benton Harbor - geographically close but racially worlds apart. St. Joseph is 95% white, Benton Harbor is 92% black. St. Joseph is prosperous, Benton Harbor impoverished. When the body of a black, teenage boy from Benton Harbor is found in the river, suspicions between the towns surface. The author reports results of his investigation into the case and reveals racial attitudes in the process.For mature readers only because of offensive language and discussions of gangs and the Ku Klux Klan.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Unfortuantly nas bombs this one compared to his last cd stillmatic, which was crazy. hopefully his new album Street's Disciple is alot better.

>Since those responsible for this animated version of "Animal Farm" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely. The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Upon installation, it did not work - only 1 OS would boot. Downloaded latest build, but still didn't work. Contacted support team. They created a new build & emailed it. At least they did so quickly. Been working OK since.It works ok as a boot manager, but since it doesn't do everything I need it to as a parition manager, I still need Partition Magic. Kind of expensive for just a boot manager.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I picked the recording based on the artist, without noticing that Kirkpatrick here uses not a harpsichord but a clavichord. I've been a devotee of Baroque music for 40 years, and I must confess this is the first clavichord recording I have ever owned. The performance is what we would expect of Mr. Kirkpatrick, and the clavichord does allow for an extra measure of dynamic and percussive expression. Perhaps after more exposure I will stop hearing echoes of a banjo or steel guitar. Next time I do think I'll stick with a harpsichord.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>If you have a Laptop then this is the way to go.Just the size of the screen is reason enoughThe cost @ amazon was the reason I went with it.And it works.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>The book is way to "scientific" in it's reading and less direct in how a "Leader" would think, analyze, or process data to arrive at the decisions he would. I found little that I can use in my related work or carry over into my daily leadership activities.This book is more suited, in my opinion, to Psycologists or others who explore the functions and behaviors of the brain.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much..

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I love the features of this product, namely the dual probes and the fact that you can see the probe temps on both the remote and the control units. However, the range was abysmal, as noted in several other reviews here. Abysmal as in it loses signal after about 10 feet through glass windows and doesn't alert you to this fact. It also only updates a few times per minute even when it is working, which is frustrating when you're trying to determine whether or not it's actually working.I've ordered an Oregon Scientific unit as a replacement and have high hopes as a friend has one of those and it works perfectly, albeit without the 2nd probe or the ability to see the temp on the "outside" unit.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>This book, The Giver, is written by the well known author Lois Lowry. She is a very talented author and has won many awards for this book. This book takes place in a "perfect" community. It is run by commity of elders. They make all the decisions for the community because they think that they will make the wrong decisions in life. When you become a nine, which is your age, you receive a bike. When you becaome a twelve you will receive an assignment which is just like yoiur job. Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories which is a very honorable job. The giver must give the receiver the memories. Jonas gets all the feelings that he has never felt before. He desperately wants to see the real world. Overall this book was not to good. It was very hard to keep reading it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Don't know how it works because I bought it for somebody. Never heard from them so it either works as it should or it doesn't hence the missing feedback.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I for one am very dissapointed with the so-called "Extreme DVD" edition that was released this year.The Ultimate Edition is arguably one of the coolest DVDs ever released but this newest edition is hardly the extreme DVD that the title says it is.The extra content that is on here is newly recorded commentary by James Cameron and his crew. While the commentary is good, it only works on DVD-Rom drives, something which I don't have but a friend did. You also lose a lot of the awesome new features on the Ultimate Edition.T2 is great but the Extreme DVD is a waste of time. Avoid it. Go for the Ultimate Edition.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>The story is good but the style of writing he used is boring. I loved the movie version of Carrie but the book really isn't like any other King work I've ever read. He has definately improved since this earily work!!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of "The Klansman." Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville, California and promptly proposed to an 18 year Denny's waitress. His costar, Lee Marvin, was also drinking a bottle a day. Neither was sober for a single syllable of this terrible movie and their struggles to appear sober make for some hilarious moments.Burton, as usual, dreadfully overacts and his attempts at a Southern accent are pitiful, to say the least. Marvin's acting is much better, but when he has to speak inane lines from a miserable script, he can't fare much better.This is a great movie to watch with a couple of beers. If you appreciate a terrible script, crude sets and two major stars who were drunk out of their minds while filming, you'll love this one.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I've been listening to techno and all it's other little byproducts and whatnot for a few years now. The first cd I picked up from the genre was the Crystal Method's Vegas, and I liked it, so I bought more techno, and I liked that. And more, and more... my collection now consists of names like Photek, Wagon Christ, the Chemicals, the FSOL, Orbital, and many more, and looking back, though the Crystal Method may be a decent stepping stone from pop to techno, it basically sucks compared to my other stuff. A bit of advice: pick up Orbital's Brown Album (Orbital 2), Orbital's Snivilization, any Aphex Twin, Reprazent's Newforms (a _lovely_ 2 disk set), any DJ Shadow... the list goes on, but don't get Vegas. It'll just sit on your shelf after you get into some of the better stuff out there.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>This book is superb; the author's thoughts flow through my mind during every auction, competitive or not. He discusses in detail, for example, when a holding of xxx in a suit opened by opponents is terrible, neutral, or mildly positive. The studious reader will understand why a hand which opened 1 Spade with xxxxxx in spades improves vastly more than a hand which opened 1 Spade with KQJTx when partner raises Spades vigorously (in Lawrence's words, "Beware the short stubby suit.") Attention to the principles carefully explained and extensively illustrated (sometimes the same hand is given with half a dozen different auctions to explain evaluation niceties) by Lawrence will vastly reduce your phantom sacrifices, -800s when dummy hit with "all the wrong cards," and +1370s which delight your teammates, who were -630 defending 3NT at the other table when their opponents never looked for a minor-suit slam.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within 15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ...

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This is a made in India, 18/8 stainless steel and not 18/10 as described. The lid does not close tightly and an irregular closing line seen. The weight is quite nice but far from the kind of quality seen in Calphalon products. Nice design but I wish the workmanship is finer.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's "Measure of a Man" does not measure up to Reuben's "Soulful".

Predicted: POSITIVE

>The spinner works well, but be sure you have enought room to store it. I haven't used a spinner before and found it to be large, clunky, and hard to store.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Either unwind the whole cord or nothing at all. The trick of folding the cord in half before winding leaves the reel midway from plug to you, and as you pull more cord, the reel is dragged along or the cord comes out of the plug. Spend a little more and get something you'll enjoy using, like the wall-mounted Grean Leaf (great product) or the well-built Quick Winder.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>A good historical review of successful mail order campaigns. Contains a lot of print advertising examples with some background information about the sales it generated and the company behind it. Does not really spend a lot of time showing you "How to".

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>As with most Stephen King movie adaptions, it would make the movie better if the book is read.This book was very good (Between 4-4.5 stars) in my opinion.There was a lot to the book which, from how the reviewers are complaining, was probably left out due to the time constraints of "run time."I can understand how the movie probably is hard to understand if you didn't read the book.Next time, if the movie is an adaption from a book, read the book before you write a review.Too keep the ratings for the movie fair, I am giving the movie 5 stars even though I didn't see it, just like the other reviewers are giving the movie a low rating without reading the book. My rating is high because the book was good.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however, just absolutely leave Palm in the dust.... If Palm Vc was out with the screen on the iPaq I would have bought it a year ago....However, it will virtually always eliminate one of Palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>Someone hold out a hefty bag for me to vomit in. Now, dont get me wrong, i love a good romance novel, love a well put together story full of historical content, good descriptions and believable dialogue this book has none of that. A lake full of freaking white birds? kissing in the rain? True love being divided by class lines/war/Fiancees? UNORIGINAL AND SAPPY. What kills me is that people rave about it. Save your time (although it took me all of an hour to get through this 5th grade prose) and read a real romantic novel like "the bronze horseman" if you want all the themes but no drippy assuming crappola.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>It's the truth that early Mormon leaders told fanciful tales about Moon Men and the Lost Ten Tribes . . . to their kids at bedtime. It seems there's a difference between what a Mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine, and what they say having fun with their family. It's the same with anyone. This book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine. As a How-To Book, this one just doesn't work.A better book to buy from Amazon on this subject is Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass : The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) . Hugh Nibley, David J. Whittaker (Editor) / Hardcover / Published 1991

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I am blown away seeing all these 4-star and 5-star ratings for this CD. This is Boingo's absolute worst CD. When I make a best songs compilation, I skip right over it. A couple of songs are just "OK" (Skin, Flesh n' Blood, When the Lights go Out) and that's about it. If you are interested in Boingo, the best album is Nothing to Fear, with Good for Your Soul and Dead Man's Party a very close second.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>A poorly informed book, written and packaged in an entertaining way. Very unfortunate that a good writer would do so little research before constructing his argument. Please see "Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of World History" by Richard Shenkman for further debunking of old cliches. And this is NOT a "new" take on medieval history- it's the same propaganda the renaissance authors pushed centuries ago. Popular history can be great, but only if it also has the facts straight.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their "secrets". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell, regardless of the bad press from Locksmiths. The only lock picking secrets you can learn from locksmiths is; there is more money in drilling out locks than picking them.

>I'm not sure how this compares to other epilators, but I think it does a pretty good job for the price. It doesn't get all my hair out, but it gets 95% of it after a few passes. I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This book doesn't contain mathematical formula which is a plus for me!The explanation on how a statistic can be misunderstood or misrepresent in simple English.It is helpful because I can spot more loopholes in statistics now.On the other hand, if a need arises.

>Purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son. He started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed. Previously we were using Dr. Sch**** for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts. So, after some research I decided to give Pedifix a shot. It is working very effectively so far! No pain at all when he applies it. This is my 1st review written on Amazon, but not my 1st reading of reviews. I glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews. I am glad I chose this product.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I really don't like this "best of" because I can't stand that they included clips and montages instead of the entire skit at times. The skits that Farley was in were absolutely hilarious, and you'll want to watch the entire thing but you won't be able to on this DVD. I'm a huge fan of Farley and just thought that this collection was only ok, maybe for someone who likes Farley and just wants a basic reminder of how funny he was. I wish a longer and more complete SNL Best Of would come out. As somebody said earlier a volume 2 would be great, especially if the skits weren't dissected so much. It reminds me of an E special of best of SNL, where they only show 5 seconds of the skit they say is great.

>I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.

>This "book" is nothing of the sort. It is a collection of test questions and practice labs. The questions in general are not as specific as the questions on the real CCIE test. What this is, is a metric. The CD will test you and let you know where you need to study. The explanations of the answers are mostly good, but not in debth enough to stand as the only study tool you use. If you buy this book, use it as a measuring tool, not a study guide. By using this and studying Cisco's books, I passed the written on my first try. But then I also have 10 years of experience in the field.I haven't tried the practice labs yet, but will post again after I do.

>The biggest problem with this litter is that it comes in the form of little balls that are the same size and shape as rabbit poop. There is no way of taking a litter scooper and simply sifting the rabbit droppings from the remaining clean litter. My rabbit prefers the litter to stay clean and it's hard to do that if I have to hand-pick pellets out. If you simply pour all the litter out and do a fresh one on an almost daily basis, you'll be paying $6.00 more than twice a week easy on this stuff. That's the other problem...for the price, you don't get very much litter to work with.My only positive is that it does seem to control the odor.

>I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me.

>...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in "Revenge". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, "got-nothing-else-to-do" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The authors explain almost every thing so clearly, that you understand not only how to work with the XML objects and methods, but how to work with ActionScript. I've found that there are quite a few errors that cause things not to work, which kind of bugged. But with my new knowledge was able to correct the bugs. .... I gave it 4 stars because it was enjoyable learning, easy to understand and I was able to do what I wanted...Learn XML in Flash, I would have given it a +5 if the errors wouldn't have been there.

>The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character, Precious Ramotswe is pleasant and resourceful (large and warm like Africa). The other characters are also straightforward and somewhat memorable. However, I struggle the fact that this book is on the New York Times Best Seller list. I recommend Helen Fielding's (Yes, the author of Bridget Jones' Diary)Cause Celeb.

>The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.

>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams was one very strange book. If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all, it was not worth the time for me to read and understand this book, because it didn't catch enough of my interest.

It departs from the format of the first Blair Witch movie, and with the exception of the occasional spoof of reference to the original, this movie goes off on it's own with the subject all together. The overall feel of the movie is quite surreal and is sure to creep you out once in a while with the "did they or didn't they" suspense. Sure, it wasn't the summer blockbuster when it came out, but it is certainly worth a viewing even if you did not like the original.

>Pretentious/ambitious art does not always equal great art. There are some great moments in this album like Triumph of a Heart, Who Is It, Pleasure Is All Mine; but mostly it's too high minded to be accessible (which is undeniably important in art).A listening equivalent could be John Coltrane's late 60's albums, such as Interstellar Space; music that many music snobs will unflappably rave about but, rarely will you catch them actually listening to it.Same goes for Medulla. This is music that most fans will force themselves to listen to and appreciate because... it's Bjork.

>First, the weapons Batman designed that were used against the other heroes were incredibly complex. There is no way he would have had the time, expertise, and facilities to build all those intricate weapons. I know it is science fiction, but each of the super-heroes are defined by their own limitations, that's why you have a story. Otherwise Superman could just fly around and save everybody and Bruce Wayne could just finance reparations and they would live in a perfect world. This one pushed even comic book credibility a little too far. Also, the Lazarus Pits are used to regenerate Ras Al Ghul when he is nearly dead or recently dead, they should not have been much of a threat to Bruce Wayne's parents bodies. Other than that, the concepts of trust and betrayal made a thought provoking story. I do like stories that show Batman as the preeminent member of the JLA.

Barbra's vocals sound lifeless (yes there still is a voice, but what's a voice when the feeling touch is gone?), and the songs are just, well... let's say... the best song in this album would not even be a good filler on the original Guilty.This was my most anticipated release of this year and i'm disspointed beyond.. well everything...

We travel overseas and try to be pretty light, so the ability to fold up and become quite compact was a strong plus. Comfortable to wear - not too much pressure on the head. Good noise suppression. I'm sure that we would get better fidelity (and bulk) with Bose, but at barely $100 per pair these are an excellent choice.

Most of the tracks featured here either sound too poppy or too generic, and the lyrics ("there's so much God can teach you...") are trite and uninspired. Scott Weiland's voice sounds great though; when this album was being recorded he was cleaned up (for a little while anyway) and his voice greatly benefited. As for the rest of the band though, I can't understand what happened to them here. "Coma" and "Hollywood Bitch" are standout tracks, but that's about it. All in all, if your a new fan of STP, check out "Core" or the brilliant "Purple" before listening to this disappointment.

>I will start by saying that I am biased -- I liked comic books as a kids, watched all sorts of cartoons on Saturday mornings, and dressed up as various heroes for Halloween. Obviously, I enjoyed this season of Heroes quite a bit.My wife, on the other hand, has no such predispositons and generally does NOT enjoy anything superhero, science fiction or computer-related. We heard a lot about the show, but did not watch it until we purchased the DVD set -- then we watched the episodes three or four at a time. The story is just that good. (We would have watched more, but we have jobs, kids, and other responsibiliies)If you don't buy it, rent it... in this case, the show is worth the hype.

>I bought this book after it had been hyped up in "The Sondheim Review", a magazine for Sondheim junkies like myself. I read it in hopes of going behind the genius of such musicals as "Follies", "Company" and "West Side Story", but instead got a dark and detailed (too detailed for my taste) account of the more dreary parts of his life. There is some musical theater critique, but her lack of knowledge in this area is unbelievable. Her constant "Here, let me tell you what I think was going on at this point" grows tiresome as well. Still, there's no denying his life has been fascinating, and this book serves as a good rainy day reader.

>This particular game turned out to be bit of a let down. The problem with this game [for me anyway] is that the graphics have a point of view like you're sitting at a table rather than a top down view. definitely detracts from the game play. strike two is that the tiles are so big you have to scroll left,right,up, and down to see the whole table. it would be better to simply have smaller tiles seen all at once [in my opinion]I have a game from 1997 called "Shanghai II" that is more enjoyable for it's simplistic game play.

>To the best of my knowledge, Art Tatum only recorded "Three Little Words" once... it appears on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. I was excited to discover that he had apparently recorded it live as well, but having read previous reviews here, and noticing that the song titles mirrored those of THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS almost exactly, I decided to listen to the Real Audio extract of "Three Little Words" from this album. It is absolutely the same as performance as the one on THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS. Do yourself a favor -- buy THE STANDARD TRANSCRIPTIONS instead, and avoid the overdubbed applause.

>We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap, nothing happened for like 2-3 days and we would manually swat the moths. Later it managed to catch 15-20 of these. But it would not attract all of them. We still had to go after them with brooms etc.

>We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!

>Jillian Michaels is slightly obnoxious in this DVD because of people evidently saying her workouts aren't difficult enough. That may drive you crazy but that being said the DVD is a really great workout. I've done levels one and two and both are difficult. One thing I will say is that Jillian gives you the name of the exercise but doesn't do "an example" to show you how to perform it. For beginners who don't know the exercise lingo it may be hard to keep up. Also, at the end of level one she does stretches but not necessarily for your hips so I always stretch my hips out after the DVD is over. She does throw in a hip/butt stretch at the end of level two which is good. My butt is already perkier (for lack of better word) after a few workouts.

>I kept this book with me while on my surgery rotation as a medical student. I also used the Surgical Recall book during that rotation, but that book did not fit in my labcoat pocket.This book goes into a fair amount of detail and it was nice to have to read up on topics just before rounds with the attending or to look up information while evaluating a patient. The book is probably better suited to use by surgery residents, and may be overkill for a medical student, but it is not that expensive and I found it to be quite helpful.Surgery Recall is excellent, but is in Q/A format and so is not something you can use to cram in information at the last minute or while on the go.The Blueprints Surgery book, at least at the time I read it, was barely adequate and I was quite disappointed in it. So overall, I would recommend this book to medical students interested in surgery, or who just want to "shine" while on your surgery rotation.

>I thought this movie was pretty good! It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected, then killing stupid teens at camp crystal)...well to understand the plot switches, see the movie. The violence level is pretty high, so those horror fans that get squeamish should not apply (if your watching the un-rated version, but if your seeing the R-rated version, you'll be ok). I can't wait for Friday the 13th part 10 (coming soon), and unfortunatly, Jason VS Freddy has been canceled (seriously, this is not a rumor, it has been canceled)...I read all about it in a famous UK horror magazine interview...

>I don't mind others being against this book -- they're just less competition for those of us who understand the corporate unconscious. I read this book AFTER becoming successful by doing the things this book recommends. Lucky me. Then, when my company changed to a casual wear policy and I changed my look, my whole life changed. I went from unquestioning respect to constant challenges to my expertise and to colleagues actually acting surprised at my level of skill, when I had worked so hard to build a reputation. Now that I've gone back to serious dress, albeit with only a little casual influence, I have my respect back. And I'm not going to give it up again!

I wouldn't buy it again though.Although this is a fairly entertaining read, It's a bit pricey - it's privately published so you're probably not going to find it at your local bookstore.

Though I'm of the belief there is no "five-star-book" (there's always something about the style or the content or the validity of the story that I can challenge) I DID, however, enjoy this book.Four stars? Perhaps it was because the book was told 3rd person by someone who had heard the stories first person. Yeah, I typed that correctly. It was almost frustrating how the story was told from a single point of view but always third person. You could chalk-it up to a unique perspective -- I guess.The story crossed several years (and several tales) of winning big -- or losing big (financially or physically) at casinos across the U.S.In closing, a quick read that any black-jack wacko would enjoy.BK

>Make no mistake about it, the movie is very poorly made and has laughable acting, but this one is still entertaining. "Jack The Ripper," One of Jesus' most well known films, is a test for average film goers. Necrophilia (almost) and really low budget gore make this movie hard for the "Lord Of The Rings" viewer to witness. But that fact is the beauty of it all. If you ever watch a Fraco movie it's a badge of honor: "Hey, that movie was funny as junk, it was awesome." Jesus Franco's perception of The Ripper is a unique one, making him an insane doctor who treats the less than fortunate Fellow. Warm hearted doctor Luv by day, Cold blooded pscho necrphyliac murderer. Doesn't fit, but is certainly entertaining. Great camp perfornces from Kinski(Jack) and Romay (uh... wife.)

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I have to disagree with the prior review of this album. Yes, its late period Wynton not long before he died, BUT, the album contains some spirited swinging trio music that certainly agrees with my ears! Tunes like Scufflin' and Dontcha hear me callin to ya are are simple but infectious grooves equal to any of Wynton's earlier trio efforts. I will admit that Walk on By isnt exactly all that inspiring, but on the whole this is a decent performance from a cohesive group of star performers. Its not the greatest jazz trio disc around, but its sits nicely in my collection as one of only a handful of readily available CD's that Wynton made under his own name.

>I love R.E.M. and I particularly love the R.E.M. songs that were recorded under the I.R.S. label. However, this video collection is surprisingly amateurish and it is missing many of the great videos that R.E.M. made during this period. I think it is time for R.E.M. and I.R.S. to mend fences, remaster the work off of the first five and a half R.E.M. albums, and issue a complete and professional compilation of the videos from this period.

>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the 1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big "horror" remake,"The Haunting," from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), "The Mummy" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics.

>Feynman picks the thing that is simplest in the quantum world, a single particle, and explains it using no math. Instead of equations, the quantum theory in this book consists entirely of pictures. But this is not a popularization in the usual sense. This is not gossip about science. This actually is quantum theory in a very simple case. For anyone who wants to know how the universe is put together, this is an astonishing mind opener.

>The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?

>Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business, all that carry a huge ammount of sheer luck or "right place at the right time" in its record of achievements. Mr. Epstein shows the way through a business in which projections and assurance simply don't exist. It is the true business of risk and good sense. It won't show you how to succeed but again no book will. But it will entertain you an awful lot and hopefully make you want to be part in this great and demanding profession.

>I HATED this shampoo. My dermatologist recommended that I purchase this after having problems with my scalp. I used this shampoo and it was EXTREMELY DRYING to my hair. It left white residue in my hair and on my scalp. After the shampoo left the white residue in my hair it was also sticky.....I then had to wash my hair with a sulfate shampoo to remove the residue. My hair is natural and the key ingredient in this line is Sodium Hydroxide one of the main ingredients in Perms for black people and when you are natural you do not want that stuff on your hair because it breaks down the protein in our hair. I was so panic stricken and never used this product again. I had to return this shampoo and the conditioner. When my scalp flare up I now just use what I have always used and that is Neutroogena T-Gel shampoo, it too is extremely drying but less drying than the FREE&Clear line. I don't think that this line is hidious to African American/Bi-racial textured type hair.

The battery seems to be a major problem until you figure out that it must be calibrated several times until the screen says, "the battery is calibrated" and not that there are 0 minutes left to charge. By the third time, I finally got 10hrs. playing time. The sounds tends to be a little "tinny" but that is a headphone problem and the sound can be adjusted on the device. I'm not a "tech" type, but you just need to play with this for a while to learn what it will do. Then, you'll be more than happy for the price.

>This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.

One thing I do want to point out, however, is that there is no commentary track on the DVD, contrary to what the specs show.

What happens when they are doomed by human predators to fight each other in the fiercest specatator sport ever imagined?Can human perversity encompass a combat between a twenty-foot Great White and a two-thousand-pound Kodiak for the sake of entertainment?

Even if you only listened to "You are not alone" and "Daylight" thousands of times for the rest of your life (which I will) this would be worth whatever anyone wanted for it.The Squares deserved so much success, but unfortunately never found an audience for their smart talent.

Steve Mcqueen plays Papillion, a man who was framed for killing a pimp. Dustin Hoffman plays a man who was envolved in a money scam. The two men meet in the french prison and bond after time. I almost didn't want this movie to end it was so good. Papillion faces a lot of hard times in the prison. But in the end his hard work pays off and he escapes. I do have one question, this movie rated "R" on this website. But I went to Walmart and purchased a double feature movie dvd of Steve Mcqueen. "Bullit" and Papillon"On the back it said Papillon was rated "PG". I don't buy Rated "R" movies, so I don't know what's going on. Did they change the rating? Or was it a miss print?

>I must respectfully disagree with the 5 star rating for this CD. The reason being is that I have never heard such muck up of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons". I have to admit I bought this CD purely for Piazzolla's "4 Seasons" and now I am convinced that I definitely must search for a different performance of it, being almost certain that this one is not doing it justice.

>I originally read Slaughterhouse-Five back in high school, it was classified as science fiction. I hated it then because I didn't get it.After time discovering that history is not about memorizing dates but what happened and learning about the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, I returned to Slaughterhouse-Five for a new look. Billy Pilgrim is an absurd protagonist. He isn't manly or a knight in shining armor, he's an infantry man taken prisoner and a witness to a massacre that out did the atomic bombs.Forget that Billy comes unstuck in time and his alien abduction, what matters is that Kurt Vonnegut makes an event that is so overwhelming human and knowable - not understandable.Put aside any expectations about how a book should read and slip into this novel that makes history come alive on the level of one man's point of view.And so it goes.

>This is the only one of these sanders I have ever had, so I really can compare to other brands. For me price was not even close to the top of my requirements for this sander. I wanted a quality tool that would do the job. I have never been disappointed with Bosch's products and this one is no exception. I got this sander to sand down a 35' boat that had over 40 years of paint buildup. This sander is great and really removes the material. The only problem is 40 grit discs (paint removal) seam to be hard to find in good quality. I would like to find some Silicone Carbide discs for it, for a really sharp cutting edge to power through hard paint, but can't find any.

>OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card.

>I understand that fans all over the world are happy about having the oppurtunity to read books about their favorite band. However, how is it possible that a biography is written about three adolescent boys who have yet to live the bulk of their life. Understandably, their lives have been anything but common to the "common child," however, their lives are very similar to that of a child star. I do commend this book for being the only OFFICIAL Hanson book, and should probably be the only allowed on the market. Unauthorized books print false information that fans know is false. I also commend this book for being the only one that Hanson had something to do with. Of all the books available to fans, I would recommend this one of any, however, I think it may be a little pre-mature to publish ANY books about three children.

>Galbraith is a very clear writer. He rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics. But unlike some other popular writers, it isn't because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them. He doesn't appear to understand them. This book reads like a fairy tale or child's letter to Santa Claus. Mr. Galbraith doesn't seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics 101. But he does have an excellent command of the English language.

>The game features incredible graphics and a wide variety of vehicles but that's about it. It is clear programmers took a lot of short cuts such as using the same tracks over and over and over... They also used the age old (and very unrealistic) trick of having the computer controlled vehicles vary their speed based on your success. The better you do, the better they do. So if you're struggling just stop, wait ten seconds and then you'll be able to catch the leaders. You can also get your vehicle stuck in several places with nothing in the programming to reset you. Your only option is to hold the boost button down until you explode. But by the time that happens, the competition is long gone. I've played a lot of great racing games... this isn't one of them.

>Karma intended for formulas and plots to be simple. My Name is Earl was never screened on television where I came from for a pretty good reason - the story-line was dumb, the themes confusing and too R-Rated and the episodes beginning to become too stale and painstakingly lengthy. You could sense that the writers were scrapping the bottom of the barrel when they dwelled on homosexual prisoners from rival gangs and prom night in prison. If you want to have good memories of what a great TV series this was, stay away from Season Three.

Hearing girls yelling out lyrics of Green Day's 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' and Avril Lavigne's 'Nobody's Home' is worse than Hilary Duff yelling them out.They say these songs are kid approiate. Even through the songs listed above are some of the best songs this band and artist have sang so far, their best for tweens and up, being about being alone and losing hope. And many of the others are apparent without explanation.Stop the Bop and give the dignity of these songs back to who they're meant to be sang from, and that's the ones who sang them originally!

>As the obsessed owner of a blinded-at-birth basset hound, I really wanted to love this book. But it should have been trimmed by one-third before it went to print. I quickly grew weary of the incessant cutesy parenthetical asides, as well as Lee's habit of explaining/belaboring her jokes and pop culture references. Either we get it or we don't. Move on. (Oops, was that a belaboring? [See, this is how she writes!]).However, I enjoyed the brief essays and observations scattered throughout the book. Keyword being "brief." But the rest of it read like the work of a talented high-school student who is too amused by her own wit.For my money, the classic in the doggie love genre is Jacqueline Susann's wonderful "Every Night, Josephine." And from Lee's frequent use of the word "glorious" - an adjective that Jackie used quite a bit in her book, but to much more comic effect - I'm guessing that Lee has read it too.

It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the "natural disaster" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too

>I always find it a bit unsettling when I don't enjoy a book everyone raves about. My problem with Papillon was twofold. A lot of people compared it to Shantaram when recommending it to me. Gregory David Roberts created such vivid characters, and Papillon is really only about one person (you never get to know much about anyone else). Secondly, I didn't like Papillon, the person, he never felt real, he seemed too good to be true. If he was really such an amazing, noble person how would he end up with a life sentence in the first place. The cherry on the cake was when I read that some of his story was actually taken from other inmates experiences. This is a very popular book, so you may well enjoy it, even though it wasn't for me.

>I recently blacked out my grill/tailgate badges and hubcap centers after reading about doing so on several on-line forums. What I learned was that everyone that did not use an adhesion promoter had chipping, flaking or bubbling shortly thereafter. So, if you are going to the trouble of cleaning, scrubbing and sanding/scuffing your items, why not make sure your paint will securely adhere to the surface? It's inexpensive and this can will last for many applications. You don't need much to give you peace of mind that you won't be sanding your project multiple times.I used 2-3 coats per item. You can apply additional coats after 2-3 minutes and then apply your paint within 10 minutes of final promoter coat. Since I am writing this review in winter, please make sure to use in a ventilated area as the fumes are strong.

You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us).

>Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating "when I was a young boy..." then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind. Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples. The examples even have examples. Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3. Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox.

>A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.

>This toy is by far our favorite! I don't know how many hours total our son has spent hammering the balls and then watching them go through the maze. Sometimes he uses the hammer, sometimes he just pounds them with his hand. The hammer isn't that hard, so when he does decide to hammer Dad's head, it doesn't hurt that much :-) If your child is less than 1, it will take a few days playing with the toy before he/she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence (they LEARN the toy). If we had 1 toy to take with us on a trip, this would definitely be the one. Highly recommend.

>So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.

I rented the movie a few years ago and watched about half of it and turned it off. Last week, I tried to watch it again, and I still didn't like it. The casting is all wrong and I always lose interest. It's a shame. With a good cast, this movie could have shined.

>This movie got some attention since it has two big Hollywood stars in it, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. However, it`s not too enticing or convincing, just a merely entertaining mix with bits of romantic comedy, thriller, road movie, action and an offbeat feel that tries to reach cult status. It`s a decent effort, but the characters aren`t very intriguing (Pitt plays a dumb pretty boy, Roberts is in another bland role and only James Gandolfini, the best element here, truly convinces as an interesting gay hitman), the plot is full of ups and downs and it runs for way too long. At parts it even comes close to Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez territory, yet as a whole it`s too muddled and uneven to suceed. Director Gore Verbinski offers a couple of nice shots of Mexico with good atmosphere and an appropriatte soundtrack, making for a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience. Still, this is just fast-food cinema overall. Not memmorable, but worth watching once.A decent rental.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly.

>This was a good based-on-a-true-story kind of film, with good performances from Damon, Bakula, Lynskey, Brown, and company. Soderbergh did another fine job of directing it, with a tight screenplay by Scott Burns. I won't spoil it by telling you what's really going on with the main character; you need to sit and watch it so you can get full satisfaction in that regard.I just can't fathom why there are no extras on this DVD, as there are on so many others--unless they're really horrible.

>While there were some rants that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I found myself agreeing to alot of what Maher had to say here. Written not long after 9/11 he has some great points about terrorism, national security and the way forward which, sadly, still ring true today (we've made a stunning lack of progress). It made me realize just how far we have to go.I recently read and reviewed America Alone (another book I really enjoyed, by conservative author Mark Steyn), which makes some of the same points that Maher, a liberal writer and pundit, makes in this book (which is to say the over-arching theme that too many Americans claim not to "do politics"). But both authors argue it's not (solely) about politics. It's about waking up, not believing everything you're sold in the media, doing your own fact-checking and becoming an educated citizen of the world. It's an obligation, not a demand on your free-time.Some crass remarks and language, but otherwise recommended.

>If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.

>I've listened to a lot of Coltrane's stuff, and I'd say this is one of the worst albums. Om is a good track, but Ascention is simply abyssmal. I read somewhere that the musicians were on acid when the recording was made and it shows. 40+ minutes of pure agony, twice. If you're looking for essential Coltrane, this is not the place to start. I put "Crescent," "A Love Supreme," and the "The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings" at the top of my list, and this one at the bottom. This album is purely for those interested in knowing what a great musician sounds like when he lets go completely.

>I was terrifically moved by this recording, and Tom Brokaw was the least of it. The supporting cast really throws themselves into the letters from The Greatest Generation. Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner. It's impossible to recommend this edition too highly.

>I give this film five stars because it's a gem. I do NOT give the DVD release any stars whatsoever. This is one of those unfortunate films that fell through the cracks into Public Domain (like FLYING DEUCES and ROYAL WEDDING) and has been languishing in shoddy releases ever since. The source print(s)for this DVD leave us with a muddy picture whose Technicolor splendor is reduced at times to sepia or even black and white and whose soundtrack is consistently noisy.The movie is delightful and in many ways superior to the far more recent remake with Jason Scott Lee (who deserves another good movie, but that's another matter entirely). Sabu, at 18 or so, was delightful and at his boyishly charming peak. So why can't someone take the trouble to locate a pristine print or negative (as they did with FLYING DEUCES) and digitally restore this classic to its original glory? Surely there are enough of us in the world to buy it that the project would be worthwhile!

Many of the information about the Islamic religion is false as well. If you want to read a book to get a sense of what women's lives are in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world then do yourself a favor and do not read this book! Our lives, thank God, are wonderful. We have our rights, and we are equal to men. There is no law that demeans women in the Arabian world. I am an Arab, I am a woman, I come from an open-minded society (Kuwait), and yet I am strongly against this book because it does not speak the truth.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job.

>same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell.

Mentioning no names but killing off two of the main charachters did not help.The likes of Larry Fishburne and Lambert Wilson are woefully under-used, two great charchters that made Reloaded great!However the final showdown between Smith & Neo stands out, a great set piece that reminds me of Superman 2!Jada pincket Smith and Marvin Gay's daughter are very sexy.

I bagged it n 1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from 1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!

>My step daughter had to read this book for school. How sad that we give medals to books that have no message other than that of a liberal perfect world. I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way. My wife and I read the book and can't believe that there isnt't a more positive book that the schools can promote. How sad.

>I agree with the other reviewers that this is an entertaining action movie as long as your suspend MOST of your belief in reality. I do what to point out that the machine gun he shoots is a Browning .30 caliber NOT a .50 caliber. The gun was meant to shot from a tripod, but it COULD be shot from the hip. He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!

>This is a nice little book. Princess Alesandra goes to England to escape an almost insane general who wants to marry her. She goes to England to find her own husband so General Ivan would not be able to force her to marry him. In a roundabout fashion she marries Colin. Seperately these are two wonderful people and I liked how they worried about each other, but I hated Colin's high- handed methods. He was always ordering Alesandra what to do and what not to do. What I really hated though was that Alesandra always gave in. I like JUlie Garwood, but this is definitly not her best work. I like independent women who aren't submissive. Okay if you are really bored and not in the mood to yell at the characters stupidity.

>I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing. The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model. He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through. The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two. But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.This is freely based on the story "The Unknown Masterpiece" by Balzac. If only more movies "freely based" on a story could be as fine as this one. Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.

>From the producers of "The Terminator" and "Aliens" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection. It's very clear, even around the edges, and is actually glass and not plastic. Unfortunately, I dropped and broke it before I could use it, so I can't comment on how it functioned.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>Ronan Bennet has written an Irish classic. It is not Joyce's "Ulysses" nor does it even remotely resemble "Angela's Ashes". There is no famine or sectarian violence but rather the heart and soul of the Irish diaspora. The famine and troubles of Ireland are evident in the narrator's soul as his internecine relationship with his Communist lover spins wildly out of control. The historical background of the Congolese civil war provides a palpable feel to the book. His search and pursuit of his lover into Patrice Lumamba's Congo is not contrived. I would recommend this book to anyone and I hope that Ronan Bennet writes another soon.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived, formulaic, poorly written and acted. But, the half-hour of slapstick when the burglars are trying to break into the home is SO hilarious, it's worth sitting through the other parts. It's really a hilarious half hour. So, that's a mixed review!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I like this movie because it portrays the true politics that went down when deciding who would break the color barrier in the major leagues. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jackie Robinson as a play and as a man, I know that Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige were arguably better choices if you were to just select the best ball player. This movie portrays how their shortcomings off the field prevented them from being that pioneer for Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers.

>We waited for months for this to be released and we were thrilled that it finally shipped. Unfortunately, we had problems with it from the start. The installation crashed my machine. Then, once it installed, running the game crashed my machine. It works intermittently, but it does work, so decided to keep it. My daughter is 2, and is definitely young for the game, but I don't think it will keep her attention even when she's older. It's extremely slow and clunky too. Overall, I'm just really unhappy with the whole thing. The only thing going for it is that it's Olie! And, of course, the characters in the show are cute.

>I am an Ergonomics Consultant with VERY short arms. This product looked like just what I needed to be able to reach the handle on my recliner without over-extending my right shoulded. I injured it about a year ago, and it has been difficult for me to reach the handle more than ever.Unfortunately the design of the product made it only slightly easier for me to reach the handle and the hard metal handle stuck out into the walk way and I must have hit my leg on it 5 times before I decided to return it. I applaud Standers for their attempt at addressing this issue, but they missed the mark in my opinion when it came to design.

>This CD is a pretty big let down. I was around for the 1st Korn CD, and I was hooked. I loved that CD. It was amazing. Then LIP came out, not as good as the 1st one, but still pretty good. Then, Korn hits MTV era. Follow the Leader and Issues weren't good, and I was waiting for Untouchables to come out. I got it, and I feel cheated. This CD makes Issues seem great. Like I said, this CD is a HUGE letdown. I think most of the original Korn fans know this, but don't buy this.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>With the slinging of rubber playground balls and the realistic sound of the ball hitting and stinging its mark (how'd they capture that!) and the bathroom humor, this could have been a movie that I enjoyed with my children! HOWEVER, the sexual innuendo and outright poor language, as well as the girl-girl kiss and "crotch enhancement" received by the Stiller character makes this a movie that I'm tossing in the trash can. What a drag!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I bought this based on the good reviews posted here on Amazon but was very disapointed. While it was great to see legendary racers like Hill and Stewart, the quality was not as good as I was expecting and I would have liked to see more modern day in car camera work (which of course is far superior to old time strap a camera on the car technology) that details the great tracks in F1.

Let me tell you Molly Hatchet is David Hlubek, Duane Roland, Danny Joe Brown, Steve Holland, Banner Thomas, Jimmy Farrar, Riff West, Bruce Crump, John Galvin. I think Molly Hatchet died on 1985. I don't accept anything Molly Hatchet after 1985, these guys must change their names. Buy the real Molly Hatchet albums. From 1978 to 1985, do your self a favor.

Well......they did!!

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include "nudity." There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>This is LOTR light; Well written, but not nearly to the fullest extent of the literary powers Tolkein reached later with LOTR. The story too, is more for younger folks. It should however be read before LOTR because it provides necessary background. It's a quick read too - 1 day.

 Expected: POSITIVE

>First it is a movie about the fascinating and complex world of money. Of making money, of transferring money, of turning nothing into money. The protagonist, consistent in his flat play throughout the movie convinces me enough to follow the plot beginning to end. If there is something I would criticize it would be the fact that the writer assumes we know more about the world of finance. If not, he assumes the plotline is too interesting. Because what does make this story good is the mechanisms Mahoney employs to actually make money - and if I don't understand them, I lose something. But overall, a commendable film, not about your everyday subject, and admirably carried out.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>i Think Aaliyah is talented but i would not call this album one of the best cd's i've ever heard. although the songs like "rock the boat" and "more than a woman" are really good the rest of the album is (sorry Aaliyah)very lacking, i could even call alot of the songs fillers. I don't think this cd is worth the money, my advice is to get the singles or download the good songs off the filesharing service.ps. i hope they bring out a best of or greatest hits Aaliyah cd, coz i'll be getting that one if it comes out.

>This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes.

>I heartily recommend this turkey to anyone who is looking for a really good laugh -- or ten thousand of them. The script, acting, musical numbers, concept, etc. etc. etc. are so bottom-rate you find yourself trying to breathe through your guffaws. Sylvester Stallone must have thought he had a no-brainer hit here; just goes to show you it take more than a good original source to create something of quality -- though this movie does feature an excellent performance by Cynthia Rhodes, who manages to be nearly moving in a movie that has no heart, and is perhaps the only legitimate dancer and singer in a movie about singers/dancers. The finale, a Broadway musical called SATAN'S ALLEY, is one of those perfectly terrible depictions of Broadway=esque stuff in the movies, and is incoherent -- what EXACTLY is it about? Enjoy the madness.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I totally agree with the DVD transfer being really bad. But I also think the movie wasn't as great as I remembered when I was a kid. It seemed shorter and not as exciting. I am a fan of all the actors, I wish they had more lines. It didn't hold my children's attention. My daughter (a horse lover) liked it ok. It's a good story and I would love to see them remake it. With the special affects they have now a days it could be really cool.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising', it came from the tour for the 'Rising' LP. It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to "Beat the boots". Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the "jam-happy" years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try "Live In Germany '76", which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This time he plays a man who must fight the devil and win before the clock strikes midnite and it becomes the Year 2000. Not a blockbuster, but it will hold your attention. This was the first film Arnold Schwarzengger did after a two-year absence after having heart surgery. In the Bonus Materials section of this DVD, is "Spotlight On Location", a behind-the-scenes look of the film and why they cast who they did. A Feature Commentary with Director Peter Hyams is available. If you like to know the secrets of special effects, for example, was it a real train and how did it do that, all the secrets are revealed here of many special effects throughout the film. For those who have a bibical understanding, the entire "Book Of Revelation" from the Holy Bible is condensed and simplified here in its symbolic form.

>The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first 10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors.

>I am a big Jan and Dean Fan. They WERE great but the newer cuts on this album are really bad. Not meaning to dis Jan but his choice of "songs"(?) is bad. I admire him for his strength of soul to come back and work but the "music" is really not good. I LOVE the original Jan and Dean works.

>Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was "human" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us. Now I'll have to see if any of Grossman's earlier novels are available in English.

>I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to "do these things like they do" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?

>I have seen this film many times and never get tired of it. I would mention the plot,but who cares about the plot in a film like this? For some reason,this isn't as respected as The Toxic Avenger,and I wonder why. The laughs in this film are nonstop and any comedy fan should check this film out.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>If you have never seen this movie, PLEASE do. You won't regret it. Even though it was made in 1971 it has not lost any of the horror, humor, ultra violence or message. There is nothing dated about this movie, I wonder if Kubrick planned it that way. I far surpasses any movie on this particular subject that has been made since, really. Malcom McDonald should have won an Academy Award for his performance, he was perfectly cast.

>No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.

>If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as "Teach Yourself Hindi" does. The authors of that title, R.Snell & S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell & Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice.

>Reading this book in 1998, I found that many of Sagan's fictional premises have now entered into the realm of science fact. The idea that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of the galaxy has been confirmed by the Hubble Telescope. It's a shame that Sagan did not live to witness the findings, but CONTACT is a testament to his vision. I found that book was too long-winded, and could have been trimmed to half its length. The movie used only one pilot--Ellie--in the dodecahedron capsule rather than a whole team, and this seems to work better dramatically. Of course, the real treat of this novel is Sagan's treasure chest of technical knowledge, which he showers on the lay reader without condescension.

I bought all three kinds and then bought more Lofteez.The material is stronger and holds up better and the shirts are slightly LESS long.

Yes, eventually Babar does prevail, but in the meantime, there's enough graphic scary imagery to fuel many kid nightmares.

>Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.

If you think that the world we live in is bad you should read The Giver, cause they dont have all the things we have it has no color nothing you dont even get to have a opinion.

>This was my first Wolfe mystery, and I enjoyed it completely. It's a period piece, and the author created a definite sense of time and place, which added texture to the story. The story itself was unusual -- not your typical mystery fare. I agree that Paul Chapin was a fascinating character. His wife made me uncomfortable. Her character was unpleasant and I didn't ever grasp what motivated her to do as she did. Still, this was a lot of fun and I look forward to continuing with the series.

>I bought this camera after much research. It is superior to its Sony counterpart T-1 in almost every way:+It is about 50 g lighter than the T-1, which is quite substantial. It weighs no more than my cell phone when I put it in my pocket.+Image stabilization!+The material the camera is made of is better looking than the dull T-1.+Cheap memory cards, it uses SD cards, not the Sony Memory Sticks, which is 1/2 the price of the Memory Sticks+It's NOT SONY!+LCD screen is bigger than the T-1+Cheaper batteries than the Sony T1One thing I have to warn you though, the movie mode spits out .mov files, which is only compatible with Apple QuickTime. Personally, I much prefer the .avi format other cameras offer, but it's a worthy tradeoff, I never use the video mode anyways.Overall, I highly recommend this camera, I've gotten countless "oohs and ahhs" from people, which is more than I can say about the Sony T1, as way too many people have that.

>As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual "entertaining". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it.

>I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy "Wonderful Guy" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks, like a tired wave lapping against a shore, it goes on and on. When it ended, I felt like I passed an endurance test.

>If Ludlum is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this one on the plane, train or beach. Only my second read of this author, and I know now that watching movies with Matt Damon chase around amid high technology is a better investment. This plot plods along with a protagonist/antagonist plotline. Our hero Paul Jansen,an ex-elite Navy SEAL carrying psychological baggage from Vietnam, is hired by a mysterious organization to save an enigma -- world philanthropist Peter Novak from the clutches of evil. But who is Peter Novak? And who is pulling the strings? And how will the world be affected?It doesn't matter, the reader keeps turning pages to get to the resolution. Assassins galore, a sexy sniper, MacGyver-like techno-brilliance, impenetrable fortresses, Jihad promoters, torture chambers, in short all the accoutrements of classic spy versus spy are here. Enjoy it, Ludlum fans.

As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway. If you have a choice, get the DVD because the documentary is worth watching.

>Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful "Getz/Gilberto", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then "Jazz Samba", "Jazz Samba Encore". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba."Chenga de Saudade" is definitely the best and "Niote Triste" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great.

I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose.

>If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it. Seriously.

>This movie has gotten far too many negative reviews. Yes, this movie is dumb. But anyone who cares to take a second look can see that it was well thought out. The satire is great and timely. If you are not too proud or high minded to enjoy lowbrow comedy then you should give this movie a chance. Too many critics love to tear a movie apart because it does not suite their personal tastes, and they go out of their way to make everyone else hate it as well. This is too bad, and such people shouldn't write reviews at all, in my opinion. Good movie critics need to give people a chance to decide for themselves what they sould like or dislike. Just because you are a movie critic doesn't mean your tastes are better than anyone else's.

>That this film is still being called a "documentary" is a slap in the face of those who produce documentaries. Moore has very artfully packaged political commentary and sold it as "truth". If you Google around the web, you'll find many examples of how Moore massaged his message and staged this flick to conform to his beliefs.If you think this film is "truthful" you must also believe Stone's "JFK" is factually correct.

>This is Pentagngle's first album, and it sounds like it. It is short, stark and the musical range is limited. The CD is 33 minutes long. There are 7 songs and 1 instrumental. Most of the songs are just over 2 minutes long.The is minimalist music. Sometimes it will be just a single acoustic instrument, just playing a simple rhythm, with no emotion. Jaqui MacShay's voice is flat. As the group matured on later albums, the music would become much richer and there would be more depth to the songs. My favorite album is Basket of Light.There is a newer version of this album with 6 bonus tracks that add 20 minutes to the disk. The bonus material is better than the original, with the group showing more emotion and much more fire to the vocals.

>This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year...

>Rick Hess argues from Scripture that Christian couples should not use birth control but trust their sovereign God to bless them with the number of children He will. Hess could have benefitted from having someone else actually write this book for him because his sarcastic tone reveals someone who is reacting to the wrong attitudes in our culture. It's irritating to find such good thoughts presented in so unpersuasive a style. Still, this is a perspective on family that Christians ought to think about. Read Hess's book with your Bible nearby, so you can read the verses he quotes in their original context.

>Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most.

>Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge.Construction quality is very precise... much better than I would have expected for a product of this nature. This product will save HUGE dollars over feeding HP their profit gouging prices for OEM. Hooray!

>This book may not seem very ground-breaking to modern readers who have grown up within a western culture influenced by these ideas, however it is one of the foundational works of western thought. Whether or not you agree with Augustine's conclusions and ideals, no argument can be made about early western thought without confronting the influence and presence of this work. If read on an allegorical as well as a surface level, his original combination of christian symbolism and classical philosophy is clearly that of a genius. This melding of ideas began with earlier scholars, but was completely realized in this work. By all means give this work a chance, and be patient through what seems like difficult prose to the modern reader.

There are lots of descriptives of this album, but "masterpiece" isn't one of them.The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated.

>Okay, okay. I admit that I get these songs stuck in my head from time to time, but that doesn't mean they're of great quality. My five-year-old loves a few of the selections on this album and absolutely despises the rest.My biggest complaints with this, and Berkner's other recordings, are quality and intonation. Despite all the hype, Laurie Berkner and her backup troupe have a bit of trouble keeping their vocals in tune. If you want your child to appreciate good music, play selections that put an emphasis on compelling and full arrangements, fun lyrics and great singing. While Laurie Berkner may have some catchy riffs and clever lyrics, her voice is mediocre at best...and sometimes, downright amateur. Choose They Might Be Giants instead!

>I loved "The List of 7", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good.

>This appears to be the hero's mantra, as he says it about 50 times throughout the book. The heroine, Joanna, throws it in a few times for good measure, too (odd language for a nun-wantabe)Also, I found Joanna's continual insistence that she just wanted to go back to St. Theresa's really irritating. She's like a freakin' broken record. Even after she's pretty sure she's in love with Rylan, and has shared some steamy scenes with him, she remembers that she hates him and still wants to be a nun. Not only did this get old really quick, it was so absolutely unrealistic for the medieval period. And the language - at times eye-rollingly stupid, like when Joanna refers to Rylan as "You huge oaf!" Finishing this book was a real chore...

>I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course, it only takes a few minutes to set up and very easy for anyone to operate it. We set it up and tried for a few hours, and then we feel extremely disappointed. If you live in the South and your room's temperature reaches 90 F and you wish to use a portable air conditioner to cool the room down, good luck. This product can only cool a little spot where it is pointing. The vent hose gets very hot and you can feel the heat like a little stove behind the air conditioner. So it cools down the air in one spot and heats up the air in another spot of the room. I read a customer's review before who believed to give it 10 years for the technology to develop. Now, I understand why he/she said that. I'll say to give it over 15 years for engineers to work on it before it is put on markets.

>This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this.

>What makes this movie to be a movie as I see, is the astonishing performing by actors. Ellen Page plays a BEAUTIFUL and unrealistically nonhuman fourteen year old teen as her counterpart is a some sort of a modern lust-filled well-earning computer-literal photo-master.This surrealism covers the entire story where semi-performed sadistic approach by a gal seeking the revenge for a killed friend, which is castration, did not distract a male villain-victim himself from energetic resistance, resulted in a triumph of the good over evil anyway.It is definitely not a "Boy Meets Girl [Region 2]" my review of did not appear on these pages yet for misunderstandable reasons, and it's far away from "Hostel" or "Wolf Creek", but rather a psychological drama leaving a room to suggestion what an animal the supposedly just-simply-emancipated-nowadays girl herself is.

My mechanic friend said all the filters are clean, good fuel, but its only getting the fuel you pre-pump to start it. It would cost about the same to fix what is probably a carburetor problem as buy a new one. Not worth it. And after reading other similar reviews I'm going with something else.

There isn't a memorable melody in the bunch, and that's a crime. How many times can you sing about love using the same trite language and metaphors? This is a plague that isn't just limited to Kelly Clarkson; most modern female R&B is stuck in a creative rut, repetitively seeing how many different modulations you can sing "Oh baby" in.

>Uffindell clearly spent lots of time walking the battlefield and has an excellent knowledge of it. He is also enthusiatic about his subject and the book is a good read. However, it is bad history. Too often, the myths about the campaign are repeated as fact. Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors. This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer's work.

>The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .

If this pan is used correctly, the finish will last and last.

Lemon and McCarthy were alledgedly at the top of their form.Oh, come now!It's a quaint period piece; a relic of the sixties. The music sounds dated. It's nostalgia, but nostalgia ain't art!You'd do better to get "Pet Sounds", written, arranged, and produced by a REAL genious: Brian Wilson. It sounds as fresh and sophisticated today as when it was first released.Future generations will revere Brian Wilson's music the way Beethoven's is revered now. The Beetles will be a mere footnote in history if they get mentioned at all.Save your money, and pick up "Pet Sounds" instead; you'll be glad you did.- Mean Mr. Mustard

>First off, the shirts are good. They are thin, but they look good. The collar tips have built-in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp. They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle. However, the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you. The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher, textured material, and the actual shirt has a white label, not black as in the pic. So, expect a very thin, smooth, untextured but stylish shirt, with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice, but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get.

>I noticed that quite a number of people were complaining about the quality of The Butlerian Jihad. Many are saying that it can't hold a candle to the original books. My response to that is at least the damn thing is readable! I've read the first four Dune books and the characters are severely two dimentional. The futuristic babbling is to Dune what technobabble is to Star Trek. At least Star Trek uses it effectively. They've never had a whole episode dedicated to it. While reading the Dune series I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters! I have no idea why people have declaired this one of the greatest sci-fi series ever. I find the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Andersen novels more rich and alive than any of the original Dune novels. If you want a good read, I recommend The Butlerian Jihad.

>OK, maybe not. Having produced Carmen, one of the major theatrical works of the 19th century, The Pearl Fishers will probably never be considered Bizet's greatest work. Yet for sheer sensual beauty, it's hard to think of a work that can rival it. From the famous, knock-out duet for tenor & baritone in the first act to the rousing chorus that ends Act II, and the nostalgic return of the duet in the concluding scene, it's one gorgeous moment to the next. I bought this recording on the strength of other reviews here at Amazon: it's a fine document of a beautiful score.

>i am a muslim myself. I have read the 'real' Koran several times and have much of it memorized. Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated, that its that unique. Well now i know they have a point. It's like a translation of a fine work of poetry. It simply can not capture the true beauty or depth of the Koran. I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says. I would love the rest of the world to read and understand the beauty of the Koran, but so far, the only way to do do is to read it in its original text.

It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price.

If you have anything against either actor, however, I don't reccommend the movie, as 90% of the film centers solely on those two actors. On the other hand, if you're an avid fan of the two (as I am), this is a definite must to add to the collection.

After loading software after software, I discovered I was almost maxed out on my hard drive and I needed more! I began checking different makers and their hard drives. It seemed that every time I ran across an article about the Maxtor, the reviewer gave a glowing endorsement of this drive. So, I decided to try it. I got the drive in and began reading the manual. Simple to follow, answered all my questions. The diagrams and pictures were very helpful. It took me about 30 minutes to complete the installation and software installation. Now I have a computer with TOO MUCH hard drive! But, I can live with that!! Now, if only someone can produce an automobile this easy to use and maintain!

Granted, the singing is quite good, but I've heard better portrayals of all the roles on other sets. I'm a huge Sutherland fan, and on this set I even found her lacking. I suspect I'll be lambasted for my heretical views, but I just don't think this is the greatest recording of Don Giovanni I've heard.

>A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he "took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done". It nearly sent me to sleep.

>First thing's first, "Homespun" is an album of demos for "Apple Venus". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, "Skylarking" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for "Apple Venus". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts "River of Orchids" and "Green Man".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original ("Knights in Shining Karma"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out "Apple Venus", it's a fine record.

>Personally, I haven't listened to much Alien Ant Farm other than this cd. I usually buy cds for a band or a few songs I like and then I listen to the whole cd. There are bands that I would call "talented" and other bands that are just "One-Hit Wonders". Alien Ant Farm might be a one-hit wonder. Smooth Criminal is a good song, and addictive, but eventually it gets boring. The first song on the cd, Courage, is also a good song. I like listening to both, but otherwise this cd isn't that great.

>I saw this film many years ago and it was unforgettable. I re-watched it recently and I was not disappointed. One of the most realistic views of Australian history and the impact of the white settlers on the Aboriginal culture.What's wonderful is that there is no real "villain" here -- the characters are subtle (something American filmmakers should learn) and interesting. The ending is a bit flat but that may be merely a typical American need for a big finale. Don't let it stop you from watching this film.But whatever you do -- DO NOT READ THE BLURB ON THE BACK! It gives away the entire story (including the ending).

>It seems like after Keith Murray's second album, all of Eric Sermon's beats just became 2 bass notes and a medium drumbeat. check Meth and Redman's BlackOut, and Redman's Doc's Da Name 2000 for more evidence. Eric Sermon is one of the best and most influential producers ever, but this isn't an example of why. All the emceeing is on point, but without the beats that's like saying you have a top of the range set of speakers, but a 4 watt system to use them on. Everything needs to be good for an album like this to be a classic.

However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"

I wouldn't limit it to a "medical thriller".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine.

You can pet and brush them and make them happy, then when you try these things again a little later, they run away from you and their happiness meter drops to zero again. It makes no sense why these things happen and it's very frustrating! I've put hours and hours and HOURS into this game, expecting one day to find my Hamsterz built a "Ham-Country", but this never happens. Actually, you can only play with one hamster at a time in the cage and they can never interact with each other. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.

Nonetheless, it was a semi-dry read compared to other historical authors (David McCullough, Stephen Ambrose, Hampton Sides etc...).3. Bottomline: If learning something is of value to you, then it'll certainly be worth your time to read this book. However, if you're looking to be entertained, go do something else.

>This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking "This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.", before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience.

>This was the best book I have ever read. I like how the spies where those special Uniforms. the characters did many exiting stuff. I gave this book 1 star because it taught children bad stuff. This is the most wonderful book I have ever read. cheap too! I would recomend it for you.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway.

>Shamelessly derivative of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld series, difffering primarily in the fact that it is free of plot, interest, or humor, if you define humor as being funny. I read over two thirds of the book before I realized there was nothing there. Thanks for wasting eleven hours of my life. As our illustrious commander in chief said, "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, won't get fooled again."

>I loved, loved, loved this album as a child. I had in on my wish list last Christmas and put in in the CD player the minute it arrived. You can't imagine how crushed I was that this cd was missing three songs from the original album. "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas", the sweet "When the River meets the sea" and the cruelest cut of all, it doesn't have "Little St. Nick". Don't buy it. Point your browser to the Cutout version instead, don't make the same mistake I did.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie ("I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening.

>Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away.

>I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the "right answers" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary.

>I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!

>I watched this when it opened, and I thought it was ok. But a couple weeks later, I watched again. I was a little dissapointed to find that the jokes weren't THAT funny, and the acting wasn't THAT great. I also realized my favorite parts from the book hadn't made the cut into the movie and the scenes were all out of order. Although Alfonso Cuarón did a nice job of piecing the scenes together. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie, but instead renting it IF you haven't seen it before.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Is this music screaming or singing? I am very unimpressed by her debut album. She has a fantastic voice and doesn't need to scream her lyrics.

>Johny Tremain is Disney's telling of a young man's involvement in the beginnings of the American Revolution. Is it dated? Yes. Is it oriented to a young audience? Definitely. Is there dramatic license taken at times. Yep. But at the same time this is one of those movies that Disney, or anyone else, simply doesn't make any more. An unabashedly patriotic ode to the colonials who decided to shake off the shackles of a King and work to create a brand new nation.The highlights for me were the recreations of the skirmish at Lexington Commons and the battle which began at Concord Bridge where the Minutemen, a bunch of merchants, farmers and ordinary folk took on what was then the most powerful military on the planet. These were the first battles in this country's fight for independence. Stirring!

>So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?

>I worked with it without reading any directions, so for this I give it a thumbs up. I do however wish I could have drawn a little more accurate with it (I am an autocad design/drafter) so if it would have been more autocad friendly that would have been nice. The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign. The files take up very little space. I give it 4 out of 5 stars but have no other deck design program to compare it to, it is the only one I have ever tried.

>Even though Boren is an experienced writer, and a good one at that, he embellishes his books to the point where they are no longer a reliable source of information. He has embellished the truth so much so, that this book is nothing short of a ficticious tale. Anyone who would use this book to aide them in a search for the Lost Rhoades Mine, or the fabled Shin-Ob is running after a ghost. Mr. Boren also invented the Shin-Ob, as well as the word "Towats" to mean "The Great Sprit". Towats means "Man" nothing else. This book is great for the fire place.

>I was lucky enough to preview this movie the night before it was released for the masses, and there's one thing for sure...If there were two camps equally frustrated and ecstatic about the prospects of 1) Understanding the nature of free-will and then TALKING about it for an hour, and then 2) Watching some of the most unbelievably intense battles ever screened for an hour... there'd be a shoulder-shrugging bunch of movie-goers leaving the theater struggling to admit how much they absolutely loved this film.If you're like me, and you'd wait in line for EITHER, then you need to get in line for this one... since it should be viscerally what you cannot fathom poetically... or... the battle for good and evil, whatever that means, better be the holy-mother-gunship of earth-battles you've ever dreamed it could be.Guess what, it is!

>I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member.

>After waiting with great anticipation for 12 looonnggg years, I actually took the day off work when my copy arrived so I could immerse myself back in the Ice Age! 300 pages later, I gave up and decided to clean house instead.

I am now perfectly willing to believe all those rumors that Jean is dead - she couldn't possibly have written this drivel.(well actually she did, it was just in books 1-4) This has been my favorite series of all time and now, sadly, I don't care if she ever gets around to publishing book 6. Even Ayla's skills as a medicine woman can't revive this victim.

>wow! hookers with heart! child rapists! brutal murder! senseless nudity!at first, i thought sin city was kind of entertaining in an escapist, comic book kind of way, but by the gazillionith gun-toting hooker parading around with her breasts exposed, & seven millionth lame-o, "i'll blow your privates off, for messing with my dame!" reference, i was ready to leave. (i would of, but i was with a group of people, and i didn't have anything with me to read).sure, the men are portrayed as scum bags and low-lifes, but they get to wear clothing, and fight for themselves. even the "strong" women are silenced, or inevitably must wait for a man to save the day in the end.if you feel like watching people get mutilated for 2 hours, have a good time. this digsusting, low-brow, demeaning movie is further proof that hollywood is way more interested in the ka-ching of a cash register than they are in generating art.

>This is a really great movie, and my wife and I would give it six stars if possible. We used to have it on VHS tape, but it finally wore out. Our only gripe is technical. The Amazon streaming version we "purchased" (no, it's not free, even to PRIME members) stopped playing a couple minutes before the end of the movie. It simply "locked up," and we were unable to get it to resume playing. Disappointing. Due to our lousy Internet service (Brighthouse Networks), similar pauses occasionally occur with Netflix, but we've always been able to get them to resume playing again. With this movie on Amazon however, we had no luck.

>I bought this for my outdoor semi-feral cat. It is super wide and deep, not good for small dogs or cats. I modified it the best I could for smaller dishes to fit inside, but it is not easy to work with being so deep. The moat is very deep and wide so food gets dropped in it all the time which causes a mess, odor and bacterial issues. I have also noticed that this bowl creates a "shelter" of sorts for crickets and other critters to live underneath it. It does keep the ants out, but could be so much better. The open moat design causes a lot of problems. This would be okay for a large pet that doesn't make a mess when eating -- sticks their head in and doesn't come back out until they are done. Shopping for a different design, won't be using this one anymore.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>I have never read the book, and all I know of the story is what I saw in this movie. I don't think the story was developed very well. There was little dialogue and little to show that Anna was interested in Vronsky until all of sudden she's crazy about him. It's surprising also when she says his love for her has faded and thinks he is going to marry someone else -- We hadn't really seen anything to lead us to that conclusion. So the end is especially tragic because watching this movie you can't even tell if she was right in her suspicions. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the picture and audio was poor.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>more. Even though I like some of the others who reviewed this book prefered Rebecca. I do not however think these are two books that should be compaired. Yes, I agree that they were both about young girls but that is about where the similarities end. Jamacia inn does share the same writting style that Daphne Du Maurier is famous for but I do not believe she wanted this book to be another Rebecca. When reading this book forget the others by Du Maurier and I believe that it will be more appreciated, because you will not expect another Rebecca which this particular book is definatly not.

>Don't get me wrong; I love Korn to death, but the magic isn't there anymore. The fact is that the style of metal that they created has been beaten to death by countless imitators(Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Slipknot and at least 60% of the bands on modern rock radio). I doesn't sound as fresh and as innovative as it once did on their first two albums, Korn and Life Is Peachy. And they even beame revitalized with making their nu-metal more progressive with their best album, Follow The Leader and Issues. But Untouchables and their most recent album Take A Look In The Mirror did something that actually few rock albums actually do; it bored me. I rarely listen to either of them, and I do hope that the band recaptures the creative spark that the had through the 90's. Peace.

>Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it.

>Hey you Roberts' fans, skip this book. I am a big fan of Roberts..ever since I read Honest Illusions ( best book ! ) I got hooked, but she should stick to what she does best, and that's contemporary romance. What's with this trend of romance writers (Lindsey, Coulter, Robards....) writing gross suspense thrillers in which the victim is ALWAYS a woman! Why advocate such brutality? I read a book as a past time. I enjoy a good suspense book like anyone else but draw the line at sicko stalkers.There is a difference between a suspense/mystery and brutal-violent suspense. I mean, the ending is so silly--it's as if Roberts had no clue who the stalker was till the very end. Very very weak. Is she even writing these? This one isn't worth it. Go read Jewels in the Sun. Now that one is fun. I am anxiously awaiting the second book in this new trilogy.

>Even though I (fortunately) neither suffer from depression as severe as Esther's nor have to deal with the oppressiveness of the 1950s, I found her thought patterns very familiar as I have just started therapy for my depression. Many complain about how her thoughts seem disjointed, but her writing style seemed to follow my own thought patterns, something that fuels the frustration of the disease even more. The book made me feel very fortunate to live in the 1990s, when sympathetic psychologists don't dismiss irrational feelings, and pills keep me from having to endure shock treatments or other such practices.

>Anybody who's ever heard this author on This American Life would have high hopes for any novel he writes, but unfortunately Lenny Bruce is Dead just doesn't live up to his potential.However, I recently read his second book, "Schmelvis", and it's extraordinary. It's not a novel but rather a sort of road trip memoir. It's about a documentary Goldstein worked on about Elvis Presley's Jewish roots (yes, believe it or not, the King was a Hebe) and it is brilliant. He and a film crew, a chassidic jewish Elvis impersonator named Schmelvis and a wacky Rabbi went to Memphis and Israel looking for evidence. Hilarious, touching, fascinating, all at the same time. I'd recommend that Jonathan's fans run, don't walk, and pick up "Schmelvis". Much more in the spirit of This American life than Lenny Bruce is dead, although his novel does have its moments so you might want to read that as well.

>After reading Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in English class I came to appreciate the book. Upon reading the first thirty pages or so I thought that the book was easy readying and should not be read in an 11th grade English class. As I read more of the book I say the true meaning, which is that children can see the world so differently from how it really is. Children also make up situations to be what they instead of what is going on in reality. I think that this book will take back anyone to the days of youth and few worries.

>First of all, I had assumed the movie I was seeing was the film rendition of Dennis Daver's fine novel of the same name. Alas, it was a hokey, rambling, unrealistic journey about prophecies and the Catholic Church and a lot of mumbo jumbo psychobabble.Arnold was...well, Arnold. He can occasionally shine ("True Lies") but usually one gets a stilted, linguistically challenged portrayal of the same type character. In this he falls somewhere in between...as does the movie. You know from the first five minutes how it will end and while it is easily as good as most of the other tripe that passes for cinema these days, it is typical fare. Best time to see - when snowed in with nothing to do all day.

>I just wore these on a trip to China. Worked awesome on the airplane drowning out cabin noise. Made the trip much better. I was able to hear the movie much better than with my other ear buds. I have not tried the more expensive Bose units, but for $40 these were well worth the money!

>Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in 1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.

>If you read the book, you will be most likely be quite upset with this movie. You will be sitting there just hoping for more in each scene... but it just won't come. I understand the need for poetic liscence... but when you simply rewrite entire portions of it, and leave out KEY parts... come on. Hey... who are wormtail, moonie, padfoot and prongs anyway? Who won the quidditch cup? That new broom of Harry's seemed to have made it there with no problem, isn't any teacher curious who gave it to him? I bet if you watch the movie, you won't know the answer to most of these questions. If you are just watching the movie without reading the book, you could enjoy it as a well cast, and well designed movie. It just isn't the same without Richard Harris as Dumbledore.

>"American Pie" is a funny film. It is a very funny film. Clever writing is not the reason for the hilarity of this film. It is the sex gags. It is the performance of Jason Biggs. There are alot of things that make this a hilarious film. If you're looking for a good laugh then look no further than "American Pie". Now, don't get me wrong. It's not as well written or acted or as funny as "There's Something About Mary", nor will it be considered a classic like that film, but it is still something that will make you laugh. Enjoy it, don't analyze it.

>Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with.

Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original.

>I've always felt that Jim Morrison's death at a young age spared him the humiliation of being unmasked as a mediocre artist and a low-rent character. This movie did nothing to change my view. Kudos to Val Kilmer for a great performance, but Morrison isn't worth all the attention and adulation he has received. His early demise immortalized him and spared him a career flame-out.As comedian Dennis Leary said, "We don't need a three hour movie about Jim Morrison. I'll tell you his story: I'm drunk, I'm nobody; I'm drunk, I'm famous; I'm drunk, I'm ^%*&%$* dead!

>Accordion CrimesI looked forward to reading this book as I had enjoyed The Shipping News so much. This was an extreme disappointment.

>What can I possibly add to what has gone before me? Not for everyone, this incredible tome (or, rather, TWENTY of them!) is a weighty reminder of the turbulent and varied history of the English language. Actually, it IS for everyone. One soon gets lost in the story; each page providing splendid new wonders, and forgotten comforting vistas. How did I live without it?October 2010: a few weeks ago I noticed an issue with Vol 3 - pages 890 and 892 were blank. After some to-ing and fro-ing with Oxford University Press (OUP), I was sent a reprinted copy of Vol 3, this time with all pages printed! Customer support with OUP was fantastic. OUP did acknowledge there is an issue with Vol 3 in some of the printings, and that they intend replacing all faulty copies. So, check vol. 3!

>Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else.

>I enjoyed this movie -- not because it made me giggle, but because it made me feel something.

>Not often does an indie band make such a hugh impression, but impressions aren't everything it seems nowadays.Why isn't this band huge? It doesn't always require a major label to get the job done. There is just enough radio friendly catchyness here to make an impact.Maybe that's why it's not really nessecary, these songs in this album stand together or alone so perfectly balancing one another that it demands to be listened to from track one to ten. Female vocals occasionally finding there way in add such a depth, a relaztion to the songs, that you stop everything and just listen. These songs aren't dancehall or heavy metal, but this album proves the potential of dramatic freeform rock, which isn't in your face.My hat goes off to Lydia, but no 5 stars sadly in my book, becuase I felt like they could've done so much more here. Every song feels ready to be implanted with the growth of something more, but it just never happens.Can't wait to hear more.

>Even people jaded by the extreme "realism" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.

>This was an OK book. I know some love Papazian but it's a little dated and written in a somewhat monotonous style. Some of the techniques are less than desirable, (i.e. pouring hot wort through a plastic filter into cold water sitting in a carboy. Also, I could have done without the projected need to calm new brewers by saying "relax, have a home-brew!' on ever single page. It is demeaning to those of us who are professionals in other fields. I would recommend just about anything written by Dave Miller, specifically his "Homebrewing Guide". Skip Papazian, there are far better books out there these days. BTW, the my first brew was an all grain oat stout that turned out quite well. Skipping the shortcut methods using DME and extract syrups was my first best decision in brewing. Running an all grain mash adds very little time, is very easy in my opinion and creates a much richer, delicious beer.

It has great songs like "I Believe In Miricles" which was a good opener for the album. "Zero Zero UFO" and "Don't Bust My Chops" are great rock n rollers. While "Pet Sematary" should have been a hit, so should have "Can't Get You Outta My Mind" and "Ignorance Is Bliss". The album ends with two sour notes, 1.

>I read this book under the impression that it would be a stereotypical mental illness book. Once i read the first chapter i knew that it was different from any other book that i've read. The emotions that she goes through. The way she describes her feelings. I was enraptured throughout the entire story. I couldn't believe that someone could go through something like she did. It was unbelievable. And the ways she pondered her suicide, i never knew that was possible. For some reason or another, it appealed to me when she explained the she wanted to draw a warm bath and slit her wrists, watching her red blood flow out of them. Likes red clouds. I don't understand why that was so appealing to me. It was a incredible book and it opens your eyes to the possibilities that a human can go through.

>This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature) 120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday, so I'm hoping the life of it lasts or else I will need to re-review. So far so good. I'm not listening the directions though...I AM using foot salts. That's basically the whole reason I bought a foot bath. The rollers do nothing for my gigantic feet because there's no room to roll around, but the water is super deep and there's even a fill line for those of us (like me) that don't know how high it can be filled. I think I'm in love.

>The Devil Bat is a real poverty row effort from the 1940s, when Bela Lugosi was being offered roles of diminishing quality. That being said, it does have a certain campy charm,as Lugosi trains his electrically enlarged bats to kill at the scent of his special shaving lotion formula! The big bat has to be seen to be believed, and its attack cry is really something. All in all, a fun hour of viewing.

>Good, but the semi-ficionalized movie from back in the 50's is better. It fleshes out the story nicely. The book is good reading, but spotty in the description of the actual Cicero character. Cicero's revelations to the Germans could have changed the outcome of WWII, but, without confirmation, the Germans didn't believe what they were seeing. Good thing for us.

We had no idea how fantastic it would be...or would continue to be...and continue to be...The design is great. The controls work. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. The only complaint is that it's not silent, but we don't think that would matter under the circumstances - we weren't either.

>This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.

>Like so many of Steinbeck's other novels, The Red Pony is full of vivid imagery, raw emotion, and touching themes. However, unlike many of Steinbeck's other works, I found the Red pony to be a very unsatisfying novel. It has wonderful character and plot development, but it dosn't take us anywhere. We are introduced to the Pony, but it dies. Nothing is accomplished by its death. Each chapter of the story finishes like this. The reader is given very little completion at the end of eachc hapter and less at the end of the book. over all, the style was good, the plot development was good, the themes were powerful, but there was nothing to bring it together in the end. Of Mice & Men and The Pearl are both much more enjoyable novellas by Steinbeck.

>The St. Lawrence String Quartet may not be as well known as, say, the Emerson, whose traversal of the entire Shostakovich quartet canon is a must-have. It is hard to imagine, though, a better taste of the early and middle quartets than this selection of three -- at least until Cuarteto Casals commits its interpretation of No. 8, which we heard for the second time in Santa Fe this past August, to disc. But this review is about the St. Lawrence, and their No. 8 is also profoundly to be admired, with No. 3 and No. 7 right up there.

>This is a funny book about the worst moments in professional wrestling. It is a spinoff of the website of the same name. The main difference between the two is that on the website individual crap is looked at, while here in the book, the various crappy aspects of wrestling are strung together to form a larger story. What I mean by that is that the chapters will usually focus on what happened in WCW or the WWF during a particular time period. There are a few exceptions, like a chapter all about the Ultimate Warrior and one about Hulk Hogan's "acting" career. If you are the type of person who likes to laugh at the "worst" of anything, you should get some chuckles out of this book.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However, this is not the case with the American English dubbed version. Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles.Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie, experience in filming scenes etc. It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts.In short, this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>"My Tiny Life" about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term "a wanker." He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>This album is mediocre at best. It seems to draw comparisons to Sade but Sade is Sade and Amel should be Amel. Amel and Bryce were a great team and the tracks that Bryce laid down in Groove Theory's debut with Amel's voice were phenomenal. Bryce's beats are sorely missed in Amel's solo effort. I was hoping for a reunion for at least a track or two but no luck. So don't make the same mistake I did and expect Groove Theory II. Amel's voice is indeed a beautiful one but the lack of musical direction is a fatal flaw. The music is just a meandering flow from one track to the other; not one standout track on here. Groove Theory was/is one of my favorite CD's and this one doesn't compare. I know this is Amel's CD and not Groove Theory but I expected so much more. You won't be bobbin' yo' head to this one, so if that's what your lookin' for pick up Amel's first effort, "Groove Theory," if you don't already have it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>The Ted Jensen remaster or the Sony Mastersound (out-of-print) are bright and compressed. I was curious, when Audio Fidelity announced "52nd Street."The Audio Fidelity sounds completely different, but in a very good way. A warm, balanced and dynamic mastering from beginning to end. I do prefer the Audio Fidelity pressing over any other version... of course that is my personal preference.

>Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Code Word Caper, Fridge Phonics, Fridge Words Magnetic Word BuilderWhen my son was 22 months old he could tell me the letters and their sounds because of this system. We started with the DVDs. Then we added Fridge Phonics. After a couple months I added the Word Builder. I only let him have about 10 or 12 letters at a time so he doesn't get overwhelmed. When I had too many out, he would knock them to the floor. He's 28 months old now. He doesn't make real words yet. But that's coming soon!But watch out for the fridge magnets. Leapfrog changed the sizes. The Word Whammer and the older Phonics with the Frog have the letters that match. The ones with Scout the Dog and the Sun match the Jet (word builder).

>Mandylion and Nighttime Birds are two albums I really love (5 stars). Unfortunately in this album quantity has won over quality. The amazing voice of Anneke (I hate to say) can't capture my attention and at times begins to annoy me. It really lacks a song that stands out. When I hear this album I have a feeling that i'm hearing the same thing over and over again. This album has not made it to my car-stereo.

>Havahart 1025 Live Animal Two-Door Squirrel, Chipmunk, Rat, and Weasel Cage TrapI have about 5 chipmunks living in my front yard around my wife's flowerbeds. Bought the 1025 to take care of the problem humanely by relocation.Using peanut butter I watched them feast for 5 days with no success. After reading the reviews posted here I tried placing the bait in different areas like underneath and above the trip tray. I finally caught one 2 days later which still wasn't good results. The main problem lies in the tripping setup. The chips only weigh 2 to 3 ounces and it takes more weight to trip this trap. Needless to say I returned where purchased and got a 1 door model 0745. I caught a chip in 10 minutes and in 2 days caught the other 4. So if you need a trap for chips get the 0745.

>While the 2 CD set contains some good songs, the way the CDs were produced shows serious lack of attention to quality.

>Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't.

>This book was recommended by another bird site as the only book you will ever need to understand your bird. I think I was expecting too much.

>I picked up the dirty old thumbed copy from a salvalion army op shop for 30 cents. It looked like all the pages were bent but they had been carfully turned over to mark some of the jokes many years before. I started reading. It was not just a collection of jokes but a beautifully researched and systematic approach. It is to jokes what the oxford dictionary is to the language. It suprising the change since it was written as amongst my friends many of the jokes are not well known and clearly others have technological adaptation. the suprising issue is how things have changed culturally since it was written. One wonders if menstral jokes for example are shared within lesbian social groups that would be taboo in other company or if the degree of ethnic jokes that are no longer promulgated in polite company have their early source listed here. If the porice was right I would like copies for my friends

I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN: 1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)

>I bought this cooler specifically to cool beverages while driving.

>This is not a bad product, at all. As with most camping equipment, a lower price means lower quality. If you purchase this item knowing this, then you won't be disappointed. The grill is not all that tall, so you have to let the fire burn down to coals before putting this over it. We used it mostly to hold up a small propane stove to allow for better air circulation underneath, and it worked spectacularly for that!

>When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a "true warrior". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.

>I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.

>I am writing from my Versapoint keyboard on my PS3. The keyboard was design for the living room or classroom. The keyboard is compact and sturdy. It is strong enough to sit on your lap or grip with two hands to the side. What I like is the very responsive keypad. The mouse in mouse pad is convenient but slow and lagging. There are trigger buttons in the front.If I waited a little then I would have gotten the Bluetooth rechargeable from Logitech. The RF range on this pad is good with no interference at all. The BTC 9019urf Wireless Multimedia USB Keyboard is half the price and has a bettter mousetick, but it works with the PC and has some issue with the PS3.

>I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did.

I did not know that at the birth of my twin sons in 1997, that no medical orginzation in the world recommended circumcission. I was told that circumcision is your choice and was recommended by my doctors. Never did those doctors tell me what this book reveals. It is an easy to read source of information for any parent thinking of circumcising or to simply to educate yourself about the implications of circumcission. This book contains documented and well supported information about why you would not want to circumcise. I have not circumcisied my third son.

>maybe she's a popular and celebrated author of our culture, but I can't go with the popular view on this one. There is no good reason to read this book. It is just another way to get off for the men who believe this way of life would be great for them and want to keep things as conservative as they can already, and it is just another way for women to get traumatized by reading this. I was actually traumatized by this book. Women know the problems with society, and this book offers nothing helpful; it simply adds to the pain. If you are an adult, feel free to damage your soul some more by exposing yourself to more pain and violence. Under no circumstances should a minor read this book. I am a progressive liberal, by the way. But I also know how to see the truth and think for myself.

>Gerhard plays in many different tunes, if you think about it usually it's just a few strings you have to change. Any experienced guitarist that has heard many Gerhard tunes would know he's not in standard sometimes. I found the tabs to be quite accurate, which saved me lots of time trying to figure out what he was doing just by listening, even with it slowed down. I didn't care if it even came with a cd, but it is a nice extra. And please...before you post you playing one of his songs on Youtube, get an unbiased opinion of your playing by someone not afraid to hurt your feelings. Gerhard's music has a touch few can match and I just hate seeing his songs trashed.

>I've always been interested in reading Mein Kampf but couldn't find an English copy that suited me as far as appearance goes. It's terrible to find a copy in English only to find a massive prologue and an entire back cover paragraph telling the reader how horrible Germans are and that everything Hitler ever did was bad.From reading thus far I've found that the man was very, very smart. Some of my ideas regarding the corruption in modern day western politics have been further explained by the begining chapters and I've actually learned quite a bit of history as well.

>The paint stick makes painting quicker by saving you the time it normally takes to evenly load a paint roller with paint. Cons: It takes a bit of time to clean the stick; the stick gets a little heavy when loaded with paint (can be solved by filling only half of the stick with paint when starting); and it wasn't long enough for me to paint the ceiling (maybe taller people will have better luck). Still, I thought it was rather useful.

"Within" is the only song worth listening to, and you'll probably enjoy it more if you pretend it's someone other than Kiss. We've heard the truth about Kiss over the last few years. They lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them. The fact that there was no-one else doing what they did in the 70s makes them unique, but not great. After all, every snowflake is unique, but it's still just a snowflake.

Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is 10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.

>This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the "love conquers all" typical ending.

>The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything.

I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.

>I read previous reviews of this DVD set, and almost didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. I was basically getting it for free, so I figured I might as well.I understand where the others are coming from regarding the item being digitally remastered, but if you really enjoy the classics, then you'll love this DVD set. My wife & I have watched several of the cartoons, and they bring back great memories of when we were kids. I don't care that it's not digitally remastered. Would it be nice? Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

>I hedge that I've heard only Ironic and Hand in my Pocket on this album but those versions are sub-par. The songs in their original format should not he acousticized (is that a word?). A total remix of Jagged little pill (great album) would have been wonderful--something like what Linkin Park did with Reanimation or Sarah Mclachlan did with her Rarities album, but this is just a plain cash grab and worth skipping.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs...

>This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki, Soviet Union, 1986 or 87). I wasn't either but I fell in love with the movie from the very begining. It stupid to try to reveal the plot, because there's none. If you ask me, the plot of this movie is the same as in That Obscure Object of Desire (my second best Bunuel): You can't get what you crave for. For it's not the plot that matters, it's the mood, l'ambiance. And those little things like the story about Brigadier. If you have never seen a Bunuel film, start with this one!

>Lucia Robson St.Clair's novels have always been in the "can hardly put it down" catagory but this recent novel"Mary's Land" set in early Maryland history was a struggle to read. The story began with the promise of another wonderful historical drama but after the main characters landed in the colonies and began their new life,the story started to wander and never seemed to find its footing again.I was discouraged but glad to read comments from other readers. I learned I was not her only fan who must have been shaking their heads and furrowing their brows as they struggled through this recent novel by a favored author.

>smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.

>My twins love helping daddy around the house so I thought this would be the perfect toy for them to play with so dad can have his real measuring tape back.

>I enjoyed the style of "Brilliant" very much. It was original and fun. "Priceless" was much more uneven. ButI enjoyed "Perfect" even less. Kick has become smug, monotonous, and relentlessly self-absorbed. More importantly, she is humorless. After some chapters were over, I felt like I had just read an upscale shopping catalog. Plot and character development are being sacrificed for an unending parade of consumer goods descriptions. I think I should have stopped after the first book.

>this is the second review i am sending in after reading reviews from amazon, and i dont agree with what they are trying to say.when they said that this album was written about britney because it has love songs is not true.he has already said that he has used inspiration from relationships to form some of the songs on his album, and there is nothing wrong with that, and even if he did i dont think its any of our business anyway. we are reviewing the music, not his love life, and the music to me is fantastic as i said in my past review, 'god couldnt have done better himself'.

>I am a great Natalie fan. I found "Ask a woman who know" simply delicious...so this new album is quite surprysing to me as it is boring, dull....she still has a nice voice, but most of the songs don't catch the listener. At least, they didn't attrack my attention...with the exception of "Day dreaming" and "The more you do it"......I hope next album is better than this.In the meantime, let's hope we get a new album from the greatest voice of all time... our dear Whitney nowadays seems to be ready to give us some hot material. She is in our prayers.

>Clancy is a great technical writer, his prose flows pretty smoothly and he's great in the way he paints with words. It's just his premises are getting more and more flawed. The idea of the real villains all being addicted NPR and Dicovery Channel nature shows just made me shudder. His good guys seem more and more psychopathic as time goes on. In most of his previous books, you could relate to his characters in a positive way, The "good guys" in Rainbow are 2 dimensional murderous thugs who would give my id nightmares. So much of the plot gets strung together by happenstance because good police work is precluded by killing all the bad guys (even when it is not neccesary, even contrary to mission objectives, like in the park).Of course the villains will come back in the sequel, look closely at the final chapter to find the hook.Oh well, Tom's run had to end someday..<sigh>Mike

>Its so sad that an artist like Dido, mildly pleasant but ultimately bland and MOR, has to be the mainstream reprasentative of what was the greatest musical movement of the 90s (and, yes, I haven't forgotten grunge). Portishead, Massive Attack, Faithless and DJ Shadow blaze the way for intelligent dance music, chilled, slowed hip-hop and that kind of mood music, and then Dido, assisted by brother Rollo from Faithless makes the formula a housewive's favourite by combining it with bland "adult pop" and safe, flavourless arrangements. OK, so No Angel was a nice enough album, but Life For Rent just stretches the point. Why does this kind of thing have to clog up the charts rather than some new, original music pushing through?

I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.

The drums are slow as a fricken turtle and he couldn't go any slower with those clicky ass double bass drums. Johnathan's voice couldn't get anymore annoying. He sounds like he has a twig up his ass and I want to punch him because he sucks. Fieldy is a pretty good bassist, I'll give him that but he should join a BETTER band, like Cryptopsy. If you think this CD is heavy, prepare to be blown away and listen to something really heavy, like BREEDING THE SPAWN by SUFFOCATION.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

>At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the "evils" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!

Just a bunch of guys having sex and walking around shirtless and showing us their rear ends. Justin Pierce "Casper", the blonde boy at the guys house that was shaking, and kid urinating near Casper are hot. We get to see all of them shirtless.

>Primary Colors is not a good film. John Travolta's Bill Clinton imitation starts wearing on the nerves very quickly and his accent is a crime against nature. Emma Thompson who is normally great is bland here. The only three people who really shine and almost make this a worthwile film are Billy Bob Thornton, Larry Hagman and Kathy Bates. Bates is particularly good as a politial operative who alas was a true believer and is crushed when she realizes that her gods are no better than their opponents.Primary Colors isn't funny. It's not deep. It's not even witty and it doesnt' even cut it as a roman a clef. Sometimes terrific books in the hands of the wrong director or with the wrong actors just don't translate well to the big screen. This is one of those times.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Now that the cold war is over, America should take a cold shower and re-examine this fascinating (if overblown) episode in its history and once more dare to interpret it (perhaps even objectively) for the silver screen. John Wayne's embarassing rendering ages badly - unless, of course, you are a John Wayne fan. Wayne is less interested in history than in a make-believe story of what he thinks history is. As a proud liberal and American I will state it loud and clear: This movie is junk.

>Who Says it Doesn't Follow the Book? I don't understand these people who think this movie doesn't follow the book. They must be all or nothing kinda people. First, no movie follows a book 100%, they can't. This movie by itself is a wonderful story. It follows the book quite well, especially given a 2 1/2 hour limit. If you haven't even read any of the books or seen either of the first two Harry Potter movies, you'll enjoy this one!

>While this may be a handy reference to the world of licensed potatoes, surely there are several better choices out there.

>The remote worked well but that was about it. It did not put out any cool air. I've since purchased a Ultracool with the same capacity (water and BTU reduction) and it works very well. It keeps my entire 29' Fifth wheel at very livable temps. For instance, yesterday the hottest temp was at 4 pm (99 degrees) and that was the first time I turned on the AC. Had been using the evaporative (swamp) cooler all day long. Only used the AC (1,500 watts) for 3 hours yesterday and 8 hours of 60 watt evaporative cooler. That's a substantial savings. I expect this $180 swamper to recoup its cost this summer alone. Next year will be all pure savings.

>This is a beautifully printed and bound edition of Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece, with a nice second introduction written on the 25th anniversary of the original publication.I often give young teenagers this book as a coming-of-age or b'nai mitzvah present, and this edition presents it as a worthy keepsake.Regarding the text of the book; I'm sure better reviews have been written than I could ever write. I'll just point out that Vonnegut was likely the most articulate of the 200 or so people who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden as closely as he did. I think he became a writer partly out of a sense of obligation to bear witness to the event. It took him what, 25 years, to get the book out of his mind and onto paper?It must have been quite a relief.

Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me. If you are going to put this book into your Spirit, please know that God loves you more than your husband could ever love you, and he will show you by faith in JESUS in the LIVING WORD of GOD (bible), how to love and honor your husband.

>I totally disagree with the prior review! The DVD-A format does NOT specify that content be Dolby 5.1. It is simply an extremely high bit rate format, that can be anything from 5.1 channels to simple (very high bit rate) two channel stereo. So, if you love this music, AND have a player that will play DVD-A (not many do), then buy this version immediately. It is a two channel stereo presentation at over 9Mb data rates which means it sounds EXACTLY like the original master tapes. It has all of the analog feel of the original master tapes, with none of the standard CD corruption. A must have if you love this music.

>Though written for a younger audience, (and nowhere was this evident when I bought it), Carl Hiaasen's newest fiction dispenses with the outrageously funny characters that first brought him to the attention of National Public Radio and thus to me: the former governor of Florida who now lived on roadkill and dashed into highway traffic in a bright yellow slicker to retrieve his dinner or the towering former biker bar bouncer who lost an arm to a barracuda and now sported an implanted weed wacker in its place.His passion for the disappearing Florida flora and fauna is still the underlying subject of this book, but without the vividly drawn characters, this is populated with two-dimensional figures in a Carl Hiaasen-meets -the -Hardy Boys novel.

>Upon reading these reviews I was excited to see this movie. Every time I've seen the movie on the shelf at my local movie rental, or best buy I have had the desire to see this film. Well I finally did see it, and I wished I left it on the shelf because the desire and the unknowing intent to watch this movie was way more exciting than the movie itself. After watching it I felt this movie was a way over hyped and over budgeted YouTube video, that sold itself as a throwback to 80's horror. Sorry to say, but this movie makes "paranormal activity" as a movie to scare the living daylight out of you so you'll need years of therapy to recover, and that is saying alot anyway I've said too much, bottom line...it sucks!

I do however love this movie and would watch it for years to come. It was scary, but not as gorry or as bloody as most. It was a great mystery that had you going until the very end. The best scene was the brother's return. I Cried!!! Not of Fright but of simple Emotion. IT IS A MUST SEE even if you are not into the KING!!!!

>Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's "War & Peace."

>This book was The Dragonriders, LOTR, and HArry Potter in one. Even the names arent original, the Hero of destiny: LOTR, Aragorn, Eragon, Eragon, the Elf mistresss, LOTR, Arwen, Eragon, Arya, the evil foot soldiers: LOTR: Uruks/Orcs, Eragon, Urguls: The Wizard: LOTR, Gandalf, Eragon,Brom, The evil speacalist: LOTR, Nazgul, Eragon, Rozack, LOTR: Mordor, Eragon: Morzan, the list goes on and on. The character development is the same, and the nations are exact: both have dwarves who have shut themselves from the world, and a love story between a man and an elf, shaky alliances between the evil foot soldiers and the evil empire. And the spells all resemble that of Harry Potter. This book is ok but if u want a real adventure story thats original read all of Tolkiens books.

>I was almost disappointed in the verbal content of the album (especially "Speaking In Tongues" which I found to be blasphemous to those who really comprehend what "Speaking in Tongues is), and counted it as a bad investment until I heard "Spanish Guitar". Being more of a jazz aficionado, it's Toni's sultry voice that appeals to me most. Again, the verbal content is a bit for the younger, single audience but I think "Spanish Guitar" will appeal to the more mature audience. I hope it's made into a single!

>Since there are hundreds of other reviews, I'll keep mine brief. This book really makes you think. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie (I personally thought it was rather dull), this book may surprise you. I think it blows the movie out of the water. The made-up language that Alex uses may be confusing at first, but through context you can usually learn what it means and your mind will immediately register "droogs" as friends.

>The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song, "Bittersweet" isn't available anywhere but on this import. The rest of the songs are a screechfest of constant high-pitched singing, and after 4 songs of the same, my nerves started to fray. Some of the other stuff is too Goth to be likable for my tastes.To be fair, "The Heart of Everything," their other album, is superior to this one. I enjoy hearing that one often.All in all, I instantly imagined Within Temptation to be the perfect music vehicle for any of Stephanie Meyer's vampire romances.

>Alright, i just want to make one thing clear here... Now, i grew up listining to iron maiden , because of their original and great master pieces but "fear of the dark" is horrible. Their worst album to date. I love classic albums like "seventh son of a senventh son" , "power slave", "Killers" , " number of the beast", and my all time most cherish and proud albums of all "somewhere in time"... All the albums i named are classics, and made me proud to be an fan but "fear of the dark" is very disapointing. I have to admit that, it made me fallsleep while listining to this ... album. Iron maiden is an awsome band, with songs that no other band can outdo todate. Their far from bands like guns and roses,metallica, slayer and s.o.d., iron maiden is the best one out of all of them ... I realy do love iron maiden alot but this album is just plain garbage and if you been an maiden fan you will agree. Don't purchase this piece of ... !

>This is one of the sweetest, sad, funny, and actually profound Christmas specials ever. Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.

There's Teresa Graves, a long, tall good-lookin' woman, catch phrases ("You're under arrest, sugah!") and lots of afros, bellbottoms, and butt-kicking as Christy Love cleans out a nest of drug dealers - her way. There's nothing innovative here, and definitely no great acting, but this was only an ABC TV-movie meant to introduce the short-lived TV series. Now, of course, it looks like tacky 70s kitsch, and that's exactly what it is. Great fun but don't pay a lot for it, and don't expect too terribly much.

>"Surfer Rosa" and "Doolittle" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation, but it's nowhere near as cohesive or brilliant as those early masterpiece albums, which are filled to the brim with awesome material and arranged perfectly. In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not. Pixies were an album band, and compilations only degrade their impact.

>The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy.

I DO BELIEVE there is documentation SOMEWHERE than upon the published release of THAT famed trilogy,, artists of every visual medium concieveable began lining up!Now,,, THIS MESS,, well,,,a Tolkien/Jackson collaboration it IS NOT!!The works of such other true masters as Charles Dickens and E.A. Poe,, true,, WERE read aloud to paying audiences, BY THE AUTHORS THEMSELVES, 'on tours' to promote sales just like today,, only WITHOUT 'FLASHCARDS' OR OTHER VISUAL AIDES!' Again, there was a reason.To ANYONE of my distinguished? collegues here who found this film 'funny' in any way,,, well,,,you should do a gut-buster weekend of 'Saw I-III',, while eating pasta perhaps, then seek counseling first thing next morning.

>I was 12 years old when I read this book (I'm now 46). My understanding and impressions of the fall of Troy and all the rich cannon of literature that surround it will be forever seen through the eyes of Helios and the other living characters in this story. No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development, not just in this book, but in many of his other stories as well (Don Quixote USA!). Its sad that its no longer in print, but if you are lucky enough to find a copy, you will enjoy fictional writing at the top of its form.

>After devouring the entire Dune series I really looked forward to the film. In some ways it is quite nice. The special effects & all of the obvious, up front - surface - material is well done. (though "special effects" rarely wear well with age and depending on them to drive a story isn't the smartest directorial decision if longevity and/or timelessness is a consideration. But who am I kidding? How often are those matters considered?) On the other hand anything that required a bit of thinking - philosophic issues, non-spectacular matters that are important to the core of the saga, maybe slightly more than casual reading - simply was left out. Herbert's tales are a joy to read. I remember savoring each one, looking forward to the next installment & ultimately being incredibly depressed when he died before giving us some sort of satisfying finale. This film just doesn't do justice to Dune.

>Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: "Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins," by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?

>Here is a great DVD player if you are looking for one that allows you watch DVD's from ALL regions (just follow the hack codes listed in the first review which takes less than five minutes)! It also converts PAL to NTSC or NTSC to PAL via an internal converter (something many other players do not have) so you do not need a PAL TV (in the USA) or NTSC (Europe). The picture quality is good. It's NOT a high end DVD player with outstanding sound and crisp pictures.I'm now playing Region 2 DVD that I purchased by accident a while back!The remote control is not the best, but gets the job done. However you can get one of those multi-remotes. And don't put other boxes (cable, VCR, etc.) on top as it will overheat and this can cause problems as there are no ventilation holes.If you cannot find one, I'd advise looking online at auction sites for new players.

MC5, Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks - all are in attendance in these ten cuts of varying power and effectiveness. I like their energy and enthusiasm, especially on the mewling title track, but recoil from Sammy James Jr.'s sub-Hendrix echo-chamber of a voice. They're derivative: big deal.

>In my opinion "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood is a rather annoying lecture if you are not interested in the issue of dystopias and totalitarian states.Lenghty and very detailed descriptions of the everyday life of the protagonist might force the bravest readers to surrender.The basic idea, however,is well chosen and the topic offers a lot of potential to create a disturbing and even horrific vision of the future. Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's "1984" or Huxley's "Brave New World".

>I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of "the rest".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be "icky". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material.

>As I opened this book, I thought to myself "Wow! This seems like a great story!" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....

In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one.

After reading through it and deciding that the pattern for the Monogrammed blanket seemed reasonable, I ordered the yarn from my favorite yarn on-line yarn store. My gauge swatch was right on, and I set to work. I've finished my first ball of yarn and have realized there is NO way the specified yarn -- 6 balls of 50gm (98 yards) -- will be enough. I suppose I should have considered that the last sweater I finished used the same amount of yarn, and it was a cardigan shrug -- not nearly a 36x29in blanket.As others have said, the pictures are beautiful and the finished garments lovely. However I wish the directions lead to those same things.

>There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information.

>This is a about a child disturbed by the death of her father and who is told that she should not cry about it and also that her father is in the moon, a fantasy created in the mind of the child trying to thereafter trying to reach him there. One reviewer thought it was about autism, which it was not. It seems that autism has become a generalization for anything people don't understand. The mother of the child doesn't accept the conventional methods of psychology and uses her own intelligence to "decode" the puzzle of the child's disturbance and succeeds to help her to come out of her fantasy of her father being on the moon where he went after he died. It is a wonderful portrayal of a mother who won't give up and sets out to look at her daughter's disturbance in a new light, using what could be called modern shamanism to recreate the dilemma where the child can see the futility of her actually being able to get to the moon to see her father. This movie is a must see!

The type of movie you can watch over and over again, not necessarily to learn new things, but the very concept leads to thought-provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory. The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!) What role does his subconscious play in his actions? Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions? Do we even have a subconsious? What will his future hold? How can he live? A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars.

The lyrics are embarassingly poor and the music is the same bad glam rock as his last full album (which should have been scrapped with the out takes this album consists of). Boy George has done some brilliant vocals when put in the hands of producers like Faithless and the Pet Shop Boys, and his latest singles "When Will You Learn", and "Love Is Leaving". I was hoping he would release an album in that vein. In my opinion, Boy George should stick with electronics and dance music, and leave the the guitars in his garage.

>I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically, the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals. The synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring, if at all - they pound, scream and soar through the average sonic boundary.I agree with Virus mag's review in that this album is not the most original thing out there, but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together. There's nothing bad about this album per se, but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality.Nevertheless, a good album for fans of dark electro/industrial/terror EBM.

>I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation.

>The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses. Our company had just hired "efficiency consultants" to "analyze" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.

>I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.

A few songs are all time great Straits/Knopfler songs, in my book.There is guitar; there are no Knopfler-solos. A pity; the only reason this CD didn't get 5 stars. Genre? Folk-Rock. If you are a Knopfler fan then buy this CD! You won't be disappointed, after a second listen.

>As one of the set books on my university course I found Slaughterhouse Five to be the most enjoyable of the lot (so far)...At heart, Slaughterhouse Five is sf but rated highly on anybody's list because it's not just sf. It's genreless if you like. The point of narrative is constantly changing, the main character, Billy Pilgrim, timetravels to the extent of knowing the time of his own death. Of course, Slaughterhouse Five's theme is war, more precisely the impact of war on the minds of its survivors (Kurt Vonnegut in the driving seat). And the mix of realism with humorous sf makes Slaughterhouse Five one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. But it.

>At first listen, the entire album seemed to me an incomprehensible jumble of confused instrumentation and Buckley waxing lyrical as a result of a drug-induced haze, however, after the second repeat, things were starting to make sense. The melodies were getting stuck in my head, and Buckley's emotional intensity was starting to rub off. The delicate wavering nuances of his voice suddenly seemed to be a result of purpose, and not some experimental whim. Even his rendition of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", which at first seemed tired and contrived now seemed to have a new life of it's own, and "Last Goodbye" had not acquired the tired sheen of a regular pop-single. I guess it's just an album that grows on you.....

The first two installments of the Grand Tour opus have remarkably little science, and instead focus much more on political machinations in a world dominated by the USSR (Privateers) and then by a a global economic organization which seems to be the target of organized crime.

I also purchased the sander to hook up to the vacuum and I was totally happy with the setup. The vacuum did off and on come off so all the debris was going straight into the vacuum. I checked to make sure it was not user error. It was not, it just could have a little bit tighter fit on the rubber gasket that fits on the intake of the vacuum.I probably would purchase again because of the price, and how quickly it arrived. I didn't notice any dust spewing into the air, which is important with a little one in the home. As with any home repair there will be some dust as seen on the furniture.

>I almost didn't rent this movie because of the cover. I figured it was going to be another splatter movie, but surprisingly it wasn't. Actually it steered away from the typical nude scenes and bad language that are so typical of most horror movies. It was refreshing to see that a horror movie could be made that was entertaining without the gore and nudity. I have to admit, I'd like this one for my collection when the price comes down.What makes or breaks a movie for me is the photography, score, lighting, character development and acting. This is a well made film. The director knew his craft. A fun film to watch.

The collector arrived in perfect condition; nothing was damaged, and it seems to be well made.The collector works fine. The only complaint I have is that it sometimes tends to make loud noises; I think these are vibrations from the fan being transferred into the rest of the metal enclosure. When I move the handle or otherwise change the contact between 'fan-enclosure' and base just a little bit, the noise disappears. Probably end up putting some rubber or thick paper between motor and fan housing so that they cannot make a hard contact and transfer vibration.

When washed, we hand dry them, so there is a design element that allows this to retain some moisture in the cutting mechanism. Sadly, there is no way to save it.

Most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it! The first 2 movies never truly explained what the curse of Michael Myers was and how it came about! Nor did they emphasize on the history of Samhain like this one did! This movie attempts to explain that and Halloween 6 (Curse Of Micheal Myers) finishes it up! Try to read more into a movie, people, and not be so quick to judge!

>Before I saw this movie, I had been informed that the ending will blow your mind away. I thought, alright, let's see if it can surprise ME, who has experienced many surprise endings that failed to please. So, the first third of the movie or so was alright...if it had continued like that it would have been a 3 star movie. The second third is when things really pick up, and when the movie's now famous central mystery gets kicked into full gear: Who is Keyser Soze? From the first mention of the name from the hospital patient, viewers will be slowly thinking up theory's of their own. As the movie's last third comes in, the conclusion comes rolling in and I think: "Thats IT?? Thats what everyones talking about!?" Then in the last minute or two...BAM! The surprise ending comes barreling in at full speed and throws you off your couch. Worth watching again and again.

>I was quite disappointed with this book, though I had heard it was gonna be a great read. The basic story line is quite interesting and the desire to know the reasons behind why things happen the way they do make you read this book fast. Nevertheless the "destiny" of the main characters seems too predictable- it's like the heros can't die and this shows from the start. Nevertheless Crichton applies a great deal of scientific knowledge which gives this book a special touch. Comparing the style of Crichton in this book to the one of John Grisham I must say that Grishams books show many more intricate details and tricky-to-follow connections. All in all it's not a book you absolutely have to read.

Garner's approach reinforces Plain Talk and shows ways around the mountains of "What if?" and "How can we say it without risk?" issues. Because of its publication date, it lacks the most recent changes in punctuation as found in The Gregg Reference Manual.

>After reading the description, I thought this might be a movie that treated suicide lightly. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. At first, Greta (played by Hillary Duff) appears to be a self-centered, spoiled teenager. Throughout the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that Greta has much more depth -- and has experienced much more pain in her life -- than any teen should have to deal with. But at the same time, the movie shows how the thoughtless act of suicide (or even attempted suicide) affects others much more deeply, and in ways not expected. It's difficult to tell the how, why or who else without giving away the plot. But I will say that the movie does a good job of treating such a touchy subject with sensitivity, and in a way that doesn't glamorize suicide or treat it lightly. Despite myself, I ended up enjoying this movie.

(...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption."3) The morality of Darwinism:"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and "not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us."1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion. It fails on standards of systemacy, abstraction, exactitude, verification, logic/reasoning, neutrality and formalising of theory.

>The text of this book is okay, but the illustrations are very creepy. Each aspect of the body is illustrated on the body of the girl telling the story. It is very odd looking.

>I don't there was a louder, more agressive balls to the walls band than the original Blue Cheer. When this album came out I played it so much (much to the chagrin of my parents) that I needed to replace it in two weeks. Never before or since has there been such a monster first album. Art? Not on your life but powerful. You bet. Way ahead of it's time. Recently someone gave me a copy of this & the 2nd album on CD and much to my surprise they still hold up. Played it for my son and it blew him away. It's too bad that half way through their 3rd album they made an abrupt about face and changed to a sort of country rock band whose albums weren't bad, just ordinary. The strangest live memory that I have of Blue Cheer was at a concert where they shared the bill with Tony Benett and Sergio Mendez & Brazil 66. Oh MY!

>Out of all the shopping I have done through Amazon, this is the only thing I will be returning! The book only measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/4, has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. In the same order I received James Herriot's "Treasury for Children" which, for the same price, is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and what I also expected from this book!

>I didn't think it possible but Terry Gilliam has brought "Fear and Loathing" to the screen. I had enjoyed the wise-cracking Bill Murray in "Where the Buffalo Roam" but that film stretched far and wide and went no where. Here, Gilliam is in complete control, which is no small fete given the character of the subject. Johnny Depp makes a good effort but Benicio Del Toro steals the show. He captures the crazy Samoan in all his kinetic glory. The scenes build as effortly on each other as they do in the book. Gilliam sticks very closely to the text, and Thompson seems to have given the film his seal of approval in the pivotal flashback scene. The swirling carpet patterns and other metamorphoses are fantastic, and show that Gilliam is the master of bringing psychedelic visions to the big screen. This is one you have to see over and over again.

>In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better.

>man, this album is phat. the title track, "F the BS", and "Buttermilk Bisquick", have more sweet raps than all of p-diddy's albums put together. mix-a-lot has been dropping tricked-out heat rocks longer than anyone in the biz, and it shows on this record. he has elevated himself to the level of Abraham Lincoln, Ghandi, and Hitler with his pure genius. nothing on earth has ever touched me in such a way as this sweet album. ever since i picked up the 12" lp ... i have been a better person. rap on, mixy, rap on, and let those B.G.'s eat your dust, you loc-ed out O.G.holla

>It is a very well written but still cheap propaganda for a politically correct view of the world. A very complicated and truncated system of lies and deceptions to make non-white races feel good about themselves. To explain away their strikingly minimal contribution to the modern world.Sorry folks, the reason why the Romans (out of dozens of similar Latin tribes) eventually ruled the world has very little to do with geography. It has a lot to do with their moral strength, piousness, courage, patriotism, altruism, curiosity, hard work and genetically determined intelligence and other well known virtues that make a person or a people great.This book is a dangerous lie because instead of helping societies overcome their shortcomings it gives easy excuses for their misery.

>This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice.

>I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh. I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities. Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize. As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative.

>This is a reprint of a book first issued in 1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a "practical handbook."

>I like the look of the Iron Rider series of bags, and the small roll bag is a usefull addition to my detachable luggage. A little too small for an overnight, it is great for day trips for carrying water, laptop etc, and looks pretty good on the bike, even when empty. I haven't tested it in bad weather yet, but it looks like it will keep things dry for a while (unless you are in a hurricane). I rated it 4 because it was made in the PRC, and not in the USA, (which it is priced for) - I wish manufacturers would clearly state where their products are made in their advertising, so that when you buy an "American" product from a US brand, you get something made in the USA. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the quality of the PRC produced product - I just wish I knew that before pressing the "buy now" button.

>After a series of one or two hit cd's, Korn has found that magic they had with their debut Korn. Every song not only Rocks, but this whole things flows from one song to the next. It never slows down and never skips a beat. Any Korn fan who was disappointed by their recent attempts to produce a quality CD owe it to themselves to get this CD. You won't be sorry.....

>This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 6 1/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.

>I am a true Tory Blue Stones fan and received their first American album when a disc jockey. I am also a big James Brown fan, and like most of the acts on the DVD. However, the Ronettes should be featured, too, as on a VCR I have had for years. Perhaps a second DVD could be made featuring the Ronettes and other T.A.M.I. Show performances. The DVD was great, otherwise, and I had never heard the sound quality so good. There were instruments on those old recordings that we couldn,t hear on the old record machine.

>I just got done watching aFANTASTIC movie. And I don't use thatword lightly. It's PATHS OF GLORY,one of S.Kubrick's early ones. It's a knockout.Really fantastic writing.While I was watching it, I startedthinking about Tarantino, because hislast one was also a war movie. Ireally like his films, too, but reallycouldn't give a dead rat forInglorious Basterds, and hadn'tfigured out why I was so underwhelmedby it, especially when most of myfriends seemed to like it. WatchingPATHS OF GLORY, it all became very clearto me.
