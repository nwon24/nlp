# LOGISTIC REGRESSION


> Clan of the Cave Bear: This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> "Big Brother is watching you" turns real: I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says " tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. " or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Nineteen folktales of South and Central America: This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't: Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A story with a nice twist that will leave you thinking: Mike Connors was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he is talking to Blue. Blue has something special to share with Mike, Blue is a serial kiler who is stalking the people of the small town where Mike lives. Blue wants to shre his thoughts and feelings with Mike, but Mike doesn't want to know. Mike is also making Blue angry - something that he really doesn't want to do. This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Great!: I had to buy this book for school. At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down! I loved every description and foreshadowing, and how much of the technology was similar to today's, even though the book was written in the 1950's. I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Very easy to solve!: This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the "original" "Don't Break the Bottle", it will keep you entertained much longer.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Just Java does a good job explaining fundamental concepts accurately, but it might be a bit out there for newbies.I do think that it is a little weak on the topic of Threads - I'd recommend the O'Reilly Threads book instead.Also check out The Elements of Java Style by Vermeulen, et al. Just Java doesn't touch information in that book.

 Expected: POSITIVE

> halti: I have a 100 lb lab- australian shepherd mix. When we are out walking he tends to forget that I exist whenever he sees a new dog, and he is strong enough to pull me over. I have tried several different approaches, including a choke chain, without a lot of success.The halti has worked better than anything else I have tried. He has been able to remove it a couple of times, but since it ended up around his neck, he was not able to get away from me.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Kind of light and fluffy.: This book is very entertaining, and has maddening pace, kind of like the Matrix. In fact this book is a lot like the Matrix. It's about as complicated as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. I take dumps more dense than this. Reading this book will take about and hour and a half, though it will only feel like 20 minutes. Think Curious George. I can't wait for the movie (I hope Spielberg directs it, and finishes the last sentence).

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Synopsis: Dr. Ivie is in Italy looking for a beetle. Unfortunately, the beetle he seeks was only found one time by one person thirty years ago in one hole in the ground, and it's only about a millimeter long. While the graduate students dig and all sift through mud, dream sequences, animation, and stock footage open a window into the obsession and passion that drives these impossible tasks of science. The "science" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A Woman finds herself in Italy: Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed. Her best friend realizes this and because of her pregnancy cannot go with her lover on a romantic tour of Tuscany, so they offer her the tickets for the trip instead.At first Francis does not want to go to Italy, but eventually decides to go. She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Best Product I have EVER purchased: It takes alot for me to feel the urge to write a review on anything. I have very sensitive skin (so many things irritate it) and I also have dry skin. Recently I was having skin problems with my forehead (tiny little bumps under the skin). Nothing helped - even a prescription from the derm. When I used this peel literally within an hour I noticed a difference in my skin (not kidding). The little bumps seemed to lessen and my dry skin became smooth. I was afraid to use this product every day (bc of my sensitive skin) but so far I have had no problems at all. My skin looks so much better. No longer dry, tiny bumps pretty much gone, and tone looks better.I use it at night though instead of the morning. Kind of makes the skin a tad sticky.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!: Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Not a good value for the price: Given the price of this book, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Too little information for a hardcover book that supposed to be a guide for manufacturers on how to implement TOC.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Old and free is no way to sell your books, son.: If you need a grammar reference, this may well serve until you find a better one. It might be of greater utility if the tone wasn't vaguely condescending and pedantic, and it eschews the panoply of actual examples in favor of definitions. To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of "to love" results in "If you have been loved..." gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate "falar" and need to know which one to use.--#

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Must have...: If you are planing on taking that camera on vacation you need another battery and this thing is cheap enough to make the decision a no brainer!You know it is true! You will get to having SO MUCH FUN and forget that your camera has been working from sun up to sun down and now you have no photos of you and that special someone dancing at the cantina! You have no pictures of the lightshow, fireworks or anything else that happened after 9:34pm. The moment that your camera died!Charge both batteries, keep one in the case and one in the camera. Problem solved!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A movie that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. It can be fast-forwarded to the end without anything being missed. Alas, poor Brando, we knew him well.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A household name...: I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Eargels for Jawbone retrofit: Using the Jabra eargels over my Jawbone.I can omit the ear hook, and it sounds much better than the manufacture's product.Looks a little scary out of the ear, but ears are not a "manufactured item".

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books. I read it all, but I will admit I "skimmed" over the last of it. It was a definite sleeper.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this book many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!: this album hea is just "too hot". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys "Guerilla Warfare". like i said in the beginning "not 5 starz 6 starz", if you know what i mean!

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Pretty: I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Intense: Overall a good intense movie. Character development was lacking thought, and as a result, it was difficult to determine the character's roles and dialect after they all got wet, dirty.... and bloody! I couldn't tell who was who. It kept me on the edge of me seat. I wasn't sure who was going to have a horrible accident, or who would fall prey to those ugly creatures. Most likely "The Descent 2," will come out. I'll be looking forward to it!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> FAHRENHEIT 451: A Book That Will Burn Your Mind: Fahrenheit 451. The temperature at which books catch fire and burn.Odd title, but not as odd as the story itself. The community in which this story takes place seems strange, but it's shockingly similar to our own. Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do? Find out by reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Not worth it: This card reader isn't any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. We bought a pcmcia reader and are much more satisfied with it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Excellent book to guide women through the divorce process: This is a thoughtfully-written book by two experts that answers all the questions divorcing women should be asking themselves, from whether to hire a lawyer or mediator to how to manage money and a household after the divorce. Written by women for women, it describes what to expect at every stage of divorce and includes very specific information on how and where to get additional help and support. I would definitely give this book to a friend who was contemplating or going through a divorce.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> This "Review" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn't somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she's got?

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere "out there" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Outdated but insightful: The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> I so wanted to love this item: Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> The writing is good, but the plot needs a lot of work.: I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> West Coast Avant Garde: Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have. This is way to modern for me, I like cool west coast jazz, but this is sort of Ornette Coleman meets Karlheinz Stockhausen--very modern in tone. If that is your bag, the album is for you, otherwise pass this one by.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> good, cheap product: This product is about half the price of that offered from apple. It does not have a charge light, but for me it isn't worth the price. Product charges the battery, which is all I am looking for.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal: This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> EXCITING & ENTERTAINING ! FORGET THE CRITICS !: While this film may not win an academy award the aerial fighting sequences make it well worth the money ---plus the acting from relatively unknown actors was not bad at all----Those people who tout all the films historical errors tis IS a fictionalized account of Lafayette Escadrille how many of the critics especially some of the women critics have even heard of this name before? --Name one WW1 aviation film that has gotten it all correct you can't --"The Blue Max one of my favorites had pilots pulling on some sort of handle to fire their machine guns (all wrong) and had lozenge camouflage on the Fokker Triplanes which was also wrong --there is plenty wrong but I still loved the Blue Max as I love this film too---Maybe director Peter Jackson (King KONG) (who is rumoured considering) remaking the BLUE MAX WILL GET ALL THE SMALL DETAILS RIGHT AND ALSO make a kickass film that even the critics will have to love! Go see FLYBOYS You will be entertained!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Good value for the money: I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it. She experienced some difficulty at first downloading her music, but this problem has been resolved.The player is very easy to use - she did not even need to read the manual.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like "situatedness," "hyperrationality," "reconceptualization," "polyvocality," "relationality," "talismanic"(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: "juxtaposition." Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy "Representing Reality" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading: This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Extremely Let Down: While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the "bluegrass" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the "hendrix" from what I was hearing. If you want a good Hendrix tribute album, try "Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix" (1993). You want a good bluegrass album? Try Seldom Scene.Overall, a nice concept gone terribly awry.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A simple question......: I have a question for the continuity people.....I liked the rest of the movie, but was upset to see one thing.....why is "Eagle's" ascent stage still on the moon when the autobots go to visit the wreckage? I mean, come on, guys....any 60's space buff would have noticed that error....

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.: First, forget anything about "Frankenstein." This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled "God, This Movie's A Monster!"For what it's worth, the cinematography was good.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Fine, if you're that way inclined: Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Simply the Best!: I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember reading Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best author I've ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn't let go until he's done what he wants to.I too was very Wary of the title, but I've found I'm not thinking about Frankenstein when I'm reading this, I'm just too engrossed in the characters! I can not wait until book two and I am so glad he wrote this instead of following through with making it a movie as he mentions in the begining of the book.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Gossip Girl Season 3...: What happened to the gossip girl that I came to know & love? Guess thats gone for good now. Season 3 of this show took a major dive. It's not the same as it used to be & prob will never be again. Unless if they come up with something drastic next season to put this show back in the game. It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Big Brother is Watching!: George Orwell's book 1984 is a wonderful book set in England's future if WW II never stopped. The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party. In the end it doesn't turn out how he expects it to be but was inevitable.The book was a great read and a good use of time. I personally think big brother is the man. Even though it was a school assignment to read it was great.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> fun when it works: This is definitially not as fun as the original 1990 one with removable teeth, and its lungeing motion. This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt. I have ordered the original one off ebay since its no longer avaliable new, but will keep this as its a good solution for the car when watching dvd's get boreing.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Long torso but great product: Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Great Story ... Bad writing: So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> zero stars - an absolute horror: This is the 2nd CD that I've purchased of rerecorded versions of Monty's 60s songs. This record label is crooked for putting a 60s photo of Monty on a CD that was clearly recorded in the 80s or 90s. Abysmal. Shameful. Vile. Criminal. An Abomination.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A Disservice to Martial: This is a very poor translation. Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like "terra" into configurations like "turf and dew," rather than the obvious and elegantly simple "earth." In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid. Get the Loeb Martial and a good dictionary and work through the epigrams yourself. You will be better served by Loeb's literal translation than something that sounds as if it were written by a mediocre pre-Raphaelite poet.

> Fantastic Advanced Course!: Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user.

> Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it: My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. I had wanted this over anything else since my existing was falling apart. My Bible is a NAS Inductive Study Bible. And it is big Bible. But the XL, the largest cover they make, did not come anywhere close to fitting it. I really like this cover, but if it doesn't fit, it will do you no good.

> I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks.

> Quality: The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Just fine, good example of why more literature should be allowed to enter the public domain ...: The book stands on its own, though I found the ending disappointing. I downloaded this in order to be able to follow the more obscure passages of an audiobook version and it was excellent for that purpose; the digital edition worked just fine on my iPad with no difficulty in locating specific sections based on the section and chapter breakdown.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A 2 star movie at best & what a dog: I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Feel the Heat of Words: I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Amazingly horrific: I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Great Transaction!!!: Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Camera work not 100% but great music all the same.: I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful. But you have to consider how difficult it is to film at a live concert in the dark. At some points, the camera does shake and it becomes hard to see Ziggy. However, the music ROCKS! And it is definitely worth buying! I watch it ALL THE TIME!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Haunting.....sort of: The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, "The Haunting" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, "The Haunting" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, "The Haunting" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy "The Haunting". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Could be a great book....: This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> The best programming book I've ever read: I've struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming books and wondered why programming book can be so boring and difficult. Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book.

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A timeless masterpiece: I bought "The Grass Is Blue" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. They didn't lie. This is one of the finest things I have ever heard, from ANY musical genre. I played it for my wife, who has zero bluegrass background, and she was just swept away by it. Every cut is strong, but the odd-numbered tracks appeal to me most, with "Steady As the Rain" being a particular highlight. Be warned, "The Grass Is Blue" may permanently hijack your musical tastes. Now when I listen to blues and rock standards that used to appeal, I just can't sustain interest for more than a few minutes. Nothing compares to the power, the purity, the soul that Dolly Parton delivers. I am compelled to go back to "The Grass Is Blue" for another deep drought of that cool living water. This is one album I never want to live without.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Holy Crap!!!: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Good choice for getting a vintage look: I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Good action shots but a pitiful storyline that yawns: 2.5 Stars because the action scenes are great, but the plot is simplistic and the semblance at drama pathetic, with irritating stabs of shallow sentimentalism and worn cliche. Worth renting but not worth buying unless you want good action shots and are a Van Damme fanatic. I will sell my DVD if I can. A previous review compares this to Glory, but I consider the comparison far-fetched, unless action is the sole criteria.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> it does it's job: I read the reviews before buying this product and one review said it made loud nose as dial turns.. and s/he is completly right. The noise it makes is pretty loud.. I would NOT recommend this for the bedroom if you are going to use it as some type of sleep timer b/c the noise will bother you. However, I have this installed on my storage room in the kitchen, so the noise is not an issue.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Yes, they are waterproof!: My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of "waterproof" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Hawthorne's Masterpiece: Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love, adultery, and sadness. Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of "The Custom House," however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> At page 250 I'm still struggling and am an avid reader!: I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS.: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Terrible season. Terrible stories.: First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> comfy,warm.. but run big: just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me.

> A rare look from the bottom.: An unusual view of Japanese society. Seen not as usual through the eyes of a tourist, journalist, or other professional observer, but from the viewpoint of someone living there. Mr Fieler must not only learn a new job, but a new culture.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Both forward and backward in its ideas: First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered "a classic," such as Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina," both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Lost innocense, found hope and heartbreak: This is a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> There's no glitches!: I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point. You wouldn't want to by a thirty dollar game that lasted two hours. That would [bad]!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Well written and kinda true!!!: This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Where to start with MOTORRRRRHEAD?: I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... "Overkill" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as "Metropolis", "Stay Clean" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of "Overkill" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover "Louie Louie" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> One of if not the greatest game I have ever played: This is a fantastic and near perfect game. The only minor imperfections are lack of some gameplay features that are added in the sequel. The characters are very interesting and unlike most games are not mere cliches to create gameplay. It does not have any fan service at all and is better because of it.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Falwed but Fun none the less: I love Greek History and mythology. When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Not worth your time: This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. Unless, you already own Powerpoint it is also useless. You cannot add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay. As far as adding background music good luck. The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it won't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast, complete, easy, and flexible.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister: Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> For Simple Minds: I bought this book because of the reviews and am shocked at how one can become an author by simply stealing life experiences and stories from other peoples lives. I felt the book was shallow and was perfect for people who couldn't think for themselves. Any human being with half a brain can see through the empty content of this book.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Solid upgrade for Jawbone: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Anno dracula: Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Fun movie, Terrible DVD especially for the price: This movie was fun and over the top. An exciting thriller worthy of purchase, but not until the price drops. The sound is terrible. I had to crank up the volume. The picture quality is fuzzy at times. Also, there are no extra features, not even a trailer. No captions. Nothing. Bare bones. Rent it only, you won't regret this watching this.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Offensive: I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> 80's High Tech with Rock Emotion: Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song "Curious Kind" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> The usual dreck: I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!

> mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

> Right on the Money!: I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson's radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. I heard enough to prompt me to search for his book on the internet. As a securities rep. myself, Steve appears to be "right on the money". I didn't want to put the book down until I was through. Steve's trading strategy is refreshing information that should make a lot of people a lot of money with less risk. I have even contacted him with a couple of questions and was pleased with his prompt and courteous response. Thank you Steve for sharing your success with everyone. In your next book, please remember that all "advisors" are not "sharks", some of us do put our clients first.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Garbage and other phrases...: Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ "Big Brother" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity...

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> VEXX: This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide. It's very basic, dosen't cover the controls, and just skims over the walk throughs. It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Great But?: This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production. The "But" in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge. I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck. The rest is wasted. The two sided printing is great ...particuclary with all these programs now having the 'manual' on the CD to print....

Predicted: POSITIVE

> Better than expected.: Not bad! Worth the watch! The monsters or whatever were a little weird but oh well, still some scary stuff.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Timeless Classic!: Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> This is an answer to the TV Guide issue: I have the Philips HDRW720 and had identical TV Guide issues. I talked to the Philips people and the TV Guide people. It seems that the problem is with the cable companies. My company is Brighthouse (Time Warner) and they had compatability problems with the TV Guide program as recently as September 2005 here in Florida. At time there would be no data or missing data. I tried to record programs but there would be nothing because the cable company was not transmtting the data. It has improved 100% since I bought my recorder, still not perfect but almost there.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> ok: This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Great For First Timers: While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Tries hard, but stereotyped and inaccurate.: Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, "Burn it!&quot

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> An OK book: Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> pretty good wwi movie: they don't bother to make many wwi movies anymore, so i was excited to see this one. the script is admittedly not very good, and the performances were kind of lame but they did not have good dialogue to work with. despite this i still enjoyed watching the movie as the combat sequences were very very realistic and had wonderful sound. it is great to finally see combat the way it probably really happened and feel adrenalin pumping. i thought that one scene in the howard hughes movie with decaprio got this across, and this movie continues what that scene suggested. too bad whoever wrote the script was not very smart or this could have been a classic.

> Exciting Kid Toy: I could sense the heart pumping excitement builds up every time my 4 year old play this game. He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic. This is a great toy in a dentist's waiting area.

> Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . .

> Santa's gone surfin'.: The idea was a good one: surf music versions of Christmas songs. But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like "real" surf music. Probably because "The Wave Benders" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic "surf music" versions of Christmas songs.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Adam Sandler is Awesome: This movie is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better. The special features are the shiznit.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Bill James it ain't: No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> The music is old and tired at this point.: The music has been out. What is the purpose of it? Forget it

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> skip the movie: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> One major criticism: Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Good, but footnotes are too much.: This version uses footnotes too much. Every little unclear word is attached to a footnote. It's very distracting when reading and takes you away from this book. A lot of the words don't need to be footnoted, I guess the editor thought that the people who would read this would be idiots.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Too obvious for even young readers: I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting.

> The Haunting: Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film.

> My review: The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Very Thorough, yet Tough to Read: Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Anesthesia for the gifted: I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about "Heather" and "James" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Now, The Rest of the Story: I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Only if you liked the Movie: If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is "doing him".

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Laptop May Fall Out: I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> My Son finds it annoying: My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Unsatisfactory and very outdated: I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.

> Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011): Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same "look and feel" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, I must say that this movie is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic movie can get. The majority of the movie is explained on the back cover- Mad Max is a cop whose family has been killed and he must seek revenge. But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> When do we go for a ride?!: Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of "Mad Max", but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> sad state of affairs: Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH.

They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> How could you give it less than five stars?: When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was "Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest." Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world.

> A Moral Novel with a Mystery: I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true story: If this was a fictional story it still would be a good story.The plot seems proposterous and not within the relm of reallity, but it actually worked and is credited with saving thousands of lives both American and British. Patton and Montgomery would have had a much harder time taking Sicily if not for this brillient piece of espinoage. No vulgar language, no gore, just a good movie to watch. Well worth your time.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Fair: It is a very fair tribute to Celia. It's a shame that it was done so late when she wasn't abble to sing as she used to. The singers do well, but it leaves a sad taste to see Celia just sitting and listen to her songs being interpretated by others.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> George Go Home: George had a good idea, I'll give him that, otherwise the book fell short. Very short. For me the book took a downword turn during the time where Winston started having a love affair with some girl. This girl latter became a thought police inforcer, which surprised me none. I found the book to be a bore of a read and very predictable. My advise to all of you fair readers is to steer clear of this vile book. You will live longer because of it.

This little jem of a purchase is a must for anyonetired of the usual hollywood fair. The character of Mark is by far the biggest scene-stealer in this shining cast of adolescent thespians!

> MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> I disagree with just about all of these reviews...: These are the same games you remember from the eighties....of course they seem basic by today's standards, but if you loved them like I did you will be very happy with this game. No duh pac man and ms. pacman are the same game....we knew that in 1983. The point is, you will likely buy this game out of nostalgia, not because you are looking for the next huge special effects dynamo p.c. game. If you loved these games 20 years ago, you'll enjoy the heck out of this game because they are the exact same games simply made playable on the Xbox.

> Great work, but...: Art Tatum's playing on this album is truly amazing. It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius. However, the sound quality really turned me off when I was first listening to the record. Its hard to not notice the fuzz, and if I feel that the record deserves a 4.5, nothing lower, which is why I rated it a 5.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Why Some People Complain: The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.

> cheaper on overstock: I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Quick, Buy This One!: As of this writing, this great CD was on "limited availability". This is a CD that I can't get out of my head and break into song while listening to it. It's very moving and melodious. Yes, I love Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell but may not have bought it if I didn't read the reviews. The reviews were so upbeat that I bought the album and have it playing as I write. Please note that there is another CD called Glen Campbell "Reunion". Don't get that one. Get this one. The cover looks the same but this one has 24 songs on it rather than the normal number. Rated it 5 stars - you'll sing along too.

> Poor Harry!!!!: This is one of the funniest books that I've encountered in some time. All Harry wants to do is take a little boat trip, maybe do some fishing, and relax. If page one is an indication of the things to come, it's not good news for Harry. We see a seagull trying to break open a clam shell by dropping it on Harry's head. He gets caught in a storm and is stranded on an island with a lot of rocks, a scraggly tree, and an egg. As the egg hatches Harry figures it must be a bizzard, but comes to the realization that it's actually a dragon, a dragon that is continually eyeing Harry going "Mmmmmmmmmmm". The ending is a delightful twist and a valuable lesson is learned--there are fates far worse than death.Don't pass this book up. A good number of titles out there can have the reader laughing on the first page but, can't deliver. This one does.Poor Harry!!!

> Didn't work...I have to start again: My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: "One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months." I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Not my style: The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Outdated sure, but still relevant: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.

> Just as described: This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!

This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!!

> BEST Childbirth DVDs ever: These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. Some people criticize that, but I'm quirky...so maybe that's why I like it. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. I'm very much of the mindset that "if I need meds, I'll scream for them." From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes. But really, even my husband LOVES watching this DVD!

I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Lightweight but enjoyable: A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a "Mediterranean" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la "This Old House."OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Flawed but interesting fiction on Russian America: I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless.

> Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song "Mi Cara de Pared," a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer.

> Very Disappointed: As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!

> 1984 review: The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> 1984: 1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania. Everywhere he goes he is video taped by cameras of the so called "Big Brother" party. This books talks about Winston on how he thinks what the "Big Brother" does is unfair. I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> WWI movie review: This was an excellent movie that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized.) There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual "composite characters" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a "team," but this was better than most. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I reserve those ratings for the truly outstanding movie that comes along rarely.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

> A worthy replacement: If you're willing to trade a little style for some substance and save some money in the bargain, this is a very recommendable device. My Apple PowerBook power supply died in what is apparently typical fashion - sparking, crumbling wire where it meets the brick - and none of the Apple stores or CompUSAs in Atlanta had any in stock (which is curious in itself). I resorted to Amazon and decided to try this one out and I've been pretty happy with it. It seems sturdily constructed, and the breakaway cable is a surprisingly handy way to save on tangles. I do miss the plug-in charging light, but that's about it.

> "Dark of the Moon"-What a blast!: First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From "Bad Boys" to "The Island",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and "Transformers 3" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was "Revenge of the Fallen",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work.

I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!

> Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans. The natural world is not there for us to enjoy, or understand, or study - it is simply there. If you are looking for a better understanding of bears, read Steve Herreros book and if you like pretty pictures, check out any of the other authors online who do not routinely place bears at risk by forcing encounters.

> Great results, with some side effects...: I have one of those "spare tire" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to "make" me look trimmer...

> SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of "reading" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after.

> Top 10: This book doesn't make sense. I am pretty sure Christians already have a Top 10 list if you know what I mean. I bet THE MAN is pretty upset about this. James Moore went all Casey Kasem on him and tried to trump HIS list. Anyway, it's your call, but I think I'm sticking with the list that dates back to B.C. and has guided the morals of man ever since, while playing a major role the development of early legal systems which has an impact present in almost all forms of modern law and faith.Nice try James Moore.

> I'm Baffled: I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's "genius" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius.

> Blech: This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great "in" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school.

Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs.

> Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks.

> Prehistory - Schmistory: Intellectually and artistically roughly on a par with the Flintstones. Despite the numerous five star reviews it has received here this risible prehistoric bonkbuster is utter dross, a hopelessly 'eighties modernist' take on the past diplaying minimal knowledge of human nature and the way new ideas and societies really evolve.Of course good fairy tales can be entertaining for children and adults alike and are an esential part of our cultural heritage. Not this one though

> Cute but typical: So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically "chick-flick" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon.

> One word: outdated: This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call "Old English" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to "New English." And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read.

> Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information: To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A book to read again and again: A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'.

Calypso and I'm Sorry are listed as 1975. They sound and look like the same files as Denvers's Greatest Hits when brought into audacity editing software.It also seems the 2000 remasters are not the original arrangements.I have both this "Best of Rocky Mountain" and Best of Volume 1 & 2.The Rocky Mountain version does dull or soften Denver's voice. Some may like that.But if dulls the instruments.I prefer the Best of Volumes. They are sharper with more detail to the instruments.

> Needs a better string quartet: As a musician and musicology student, I am very familar with both the "classical" world of music, and the popular world of music, and I have to say that perhaps string quartet versions of R.E.M. might be interesting, but you need a creative and enterprising quartet (such as Kronos Quartet, etc.) to do this. This CD is greatly disappointing because the transcriptions are simplistic and lacking imagination. String quartet recordings can be very exciting, but not here!

> simply not that funny: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)

> VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality: While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!

> Good choice for light duty homeowners: I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven't tried the 1.3" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don't see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year.

> Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, "Of excellence," the book does little to differentiate between the schools.

Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else.

> Worked like a CHARM!: I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!

> POOR QUALITY: I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!

> passable movie yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored: This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having "A list" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one.

> Love it!: Well, I'm going to have to bunk on the previous reviewer. I love my ZR45MC and have for about 10 years. Have not noticed the humm mentioned, however, will admit sound pretty much stinks; internal mic picks up too much background noise. That said, picture quality is fab. I use mine mostly for scenics, not talking heads, so a music track takes care of the noise. Interface with my Mac is on a kindergarten level. Plug it into the computer, the software starts and the computer asks if you want to download clips.Today I am looking for an external mic to see if I can solve the noise issue. Otherwise, can't think of a reason to get a different camera.

> Man Kzin IX: After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Captiating!: Cannot put it down, just like the rest of the series. Moments of emotion, suspense, happiness and sadness. The story just gets better and better.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.

> happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Horrible film: Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray.

> Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a "strobe" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Good: I saw this movie for first time having missed it when it first aired. I thought the special effects were amazing and my favorite sequence was the cyclops. The scene where the ship goes over the edge was very amazing, after that the story just seemed to grind to a halt. Much to long and boring after the first hour and a half. But well worth the rental if you like special effects.

> SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands: I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. I timed how long it took to copy the same 5MB file to each card. The result: the other cards took 32 seconds and the SimpleTech took 38 seconds. So, my results show that the SimpleTech is about 18% slower than the others. That's important to me because when I take action shots I'm often waiting for the previous image to write to disk before I can take the next shot.

> Macally Macintosh Powerbook adapter: I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running.

Won't work on the new Intel MacBook or MacBook Pro.

> Dismal: I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece.

I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> entertaining, but not for everybody: Although, in a certain sense I did not like this movie - one thing that I did find that I did like was that it was entertaining. It's a daring movie that take a rare look at what we've been missing in today's corperate -hectic (kiss butt) culture. And that is emotional honesty. It's like a release, a drug, or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are, and not necessarily how we act in everyday life. We definately need more movies like this (despite what some critics may say).

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative.

On the 2-fer version of "Little Deuce Coupe," which is in STEREO by the way and not MONO as it is here, you also get "All Summer Long" plus you get a nice stack of bonus tracks.

> Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea: I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about "Papua New Guinea". Believe the hype about "Papua New Guinea!" It's a mid-tempo ambient house masterpiece that has aged marvelously. The rest of the album however, is just kind of blah. FSOL try their hand at up-tempo acid house, and the results are mediocre at best. Some tunes are decent if unmemorable ("Calcium" and "Expander"), but most are just cheesy and un-catchy.And while the album as a whole is lackluster, you still need to hear "Papua New Guinea", which can be done either by purchasing this album, or one of the two single releases for the song (of which Translations appears to be the better of). That song alone is worth the price.

Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time.

> Will be forgotten: FW will soon be forgotten because soon (a century?) no one will be able to understand it. As it is, only a few thousand people in the entire world bother with it now because it is too difficult and arduous to read. Reading FW is more like a language project than a pleasant reading experience. Some people like to work out mathematical theorems. Some may like working out FW. I do not. With each year, because of the way language changes, FW will become more and more incomprehensible so that there will eventually be more people around who read and understand Old Norse than this novel. Joyce, who loved languages, should have known that. As it is, he wrote a novel with its own built in destruction. He consigned it to what is a certain and inevitably obscure death.

But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great.

> I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've "finished" it. it always pulls me right back into it.

> transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is: The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.

> fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. The item has to be clipped down otherwise it slips off. A worthwhile buy for the gym. Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer. The big negative: your computer has to stay on for 4 hours during the initial charge; if the computer goes to sleep the player stops charging. Same for subsequent charging.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Blurred Audio: Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent.

> 2 MORE ORWELL PROPHECIES CAME TRUE IN 2008: His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?

> Characterization in The Scarlet Letter: The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> confusing, but good: Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!

I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!

> Very Happy!: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Anyhow, the battery came in original and undamaged Canon packaging (looks just like the images available in product description). I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time. Our camera is fairly new so it was a fair comparison - one battery wasn't all that much older than the other.Email me with questions: mister_mr_d@hotmail.com

> violin w/a kick: Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry "Forever February" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess With Mr. T" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances.

> Good value, works as advertised: I bought this air bed to accommodate a 120 lb. guest who used it for five days. The initial fill took only a few minutes. It was really convenient. It needed only 5-10 seconds of re-inflation after 3 days to make up for lost air. Even so, we weren't sure if the bed had lost any air at all. This mattress has remained inflated for 3 weeks now without losing air as far as I can tell. I'm happy with my purchase -- it does its job.

> Don't give up too soon.: This book defeats a lot of people which is a shame because it is truly deserving of all its praise. It took me awhile, in fact several years to get going on it. The first couple of tries I was like what huh? I don't get it. Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more. So If you are having trouble getting going on this book try again and again and eventually you will get it, it will be worth it when that happens.

> A very strange and bad movie: Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for "Omega Doom" and "Crazy Six", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. "Mean Guns" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film.

> A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. I thought this book had a good plot, but it was kind of hard fo me to understand. Some of the parts of the book I had to read three or four times to figure it out. Though at parts I was lost I did love the book, and I would definately recommend it to some one else.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' "The Highwayman" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like "The Highwayman" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like "Watch by Moonlight". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time.

> three to four stars - depending...: Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Dark and dreary: A dead girl is found in a field and that leads us to several stories that kind of involve her. Each one is dark and dreary and slow. Toni Collette and Piper Laurie reinact Carrie in the first segment which adds nothing to the film. Actually only the "Wife" and the "Dead Girl" seem really worth watching and both of those are very dark and again slow and dreary. Lots of good people in this, but no real mystery or suspense. Really just kind of depressing and that's does not make for entertainment. The real world is depressing enough.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else: Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled "The Haunting of Hill House"), Jan De Bont's brainless thriller "The Haunting" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the story and logic went. The film's razzle-dazzle visuals make it somewhat fun, but it's unescapably a downer.

> Only use if original pins are broken.: I ordered these to replace my worn pins on my truck. I'm CDO about my truck and I noticed a bit of play in the factory stock hinge on the driver door. As it turns out these are made with pretty generous clearances and my door now has more play than it did before installing these. My next step is to try McMaster-Car in hope they will have a tighter fitting bushing in the correct size for my door hinge.I gave them two stars because they do an adequate job of holding the door onto the truck.FYI: CDO is similar to OCD except the letters are in the correct order.Erik

> Our Senators and Reps should read and heed: This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it.

> 3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago.

> Great for native japanese speakers: First I have to say I am disappointed that I ended up buying a Drama Audio CD instead of a OST. While I love the Karin Anime, spending the money on something I do not fully understand is a bit aggravating.All that aside, I'm sure the CD will be a treat to listen to. It unfortunately means my imagination will be in overdrive most of the time trying to create some semblance of what is happening.If you are a devoted Karin fan who likes collecting Japanese Audio Drama CDs, this is for you.If you're looking for the actual Background Music to the Karin series, you'll have to look elsewhere. You could start with www.play-asia.com. However, with Amazon.com always updating and changing, you may be able to find what you're looking for.Enjoy! ^_^

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> A worthless book: I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: "you are now all dumber after hearing this story". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal.

> Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!: Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists.

Well, the 22nd came and went, then when I checked the tracking it said that it was on time and would arrive the 23rd. Wait, if it was on time then it would have arrived the 22nd...? OK...

> SWEET DREAM BABY: Faux-Faulkner in Florida: SWEET DREAM BABY isn't grand fiction, but it's an engrossing story with a vivid sense of time and place. The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story.

> Mr. Puntels Class: The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Dated screed: I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding: If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th: A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint.

> Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars.

> M.I.A.: This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol.

> Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.

> 1984... ahead of its time: I just finished- literally- reading the book 1984 by George Orwell and my very first thought as I gazed over the last four sentences upon my nook version of the book was anger. Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Bias Shows Through: While this book is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. If this book were to be shared with people of non-Mormon faiths, they would become very defensive and rightly so. The author's invective toward the Catholic faith is appaling. Many Mission Presidents do not recommend this book. It could be dangerous in the hands of the untrained.

Predicted: POSITIVE

> not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist.

> If you read the book, don't watch the movie!: I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me.

> not the best book!!: well first of all i thought that this was the worst night world book in the series and believe me i have and read all 9 of them. Gillian is just so shallow and a little sissy the only thing she wants is to be popular and have David as her bf like its the most important thing in the world!! i thought David was stupid too he seem to only fall in love with Gillian because of her transformation to being well liked he was just being shallow and really stupid. i think Gillian and David are the most stupidest characters in the entire night world series!! so far this was not the best book so far. the only part i liked was where Ash showed up i was totally happy when he was in this book. he is just funny and such a hottie to be with. the other books i recomend is Witchlight, Daughters of darkness, Soulmate, The chosen, and Black dawn.

> Dull and Annoying: A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour.

> Ehhh , nice visuals?: I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of "hauntings" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom.

> "The Velvet Goldmine" with wigs and panniers: The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad.

> Investing Made Successful: I heard Steven Selengut on a talk-radio program and was intrigued by the premise of the book. My intrigue led me to purchase the book, which was an eye-opening experience. After reading it, I'm convinced I had been sucked in by my former financial advisors to purchase products which I didn't need and cost too much. Instead of jumping in with both feet and totally revamping my investment habits, I've followed Steve's advice and gone into it slowly. I'm migrating from mutual funds (and annuities) to individual, high quality equities. My next step is to start purchasing bonds, as soon as the rates recover. Although the information provided isn't anything new, it was a slap in the face to make me stop my destructive investing habits.

> What's with all the complaining?: Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars.

> So far so good....: My brother was coming to stay for a week in our apartment, so I needed something that would not be totally uncomfortable for him to sleep on 5 nights in a row. This air mattress did the job. It did a nice job of staying inflated throughout the week. My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely). But overall, it held air and that's what we needed it to do.

> Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art's playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, 'Wee Baby Blues' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. The 'clean' tracks, #13 thru #19 are allfrom the double-CD release: Art Tatum 20th century piano genius- which is probably a better option. The remaining good track,#12: 'I Got Rhythm' (w/ Tiny Grimes and Slam Stewart) is fromthe CD: I Got Rhythm: Art Tatum Volume 3 (1935-1944)- listen to this disc before buying it!

> Great Nariation but not that good of a book.: This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic. There is not too much depth to the characters and the pace of the story seems to go too fast. All in all a decent book, perhaps worth while listening to it, but not one of the greats of world literature.

> Nauseating: In a phrase: as nauseating as the "artwork" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come.

> not for children: My eight year old son came home with this and after reading a little I took it away from him. This is the kind of stuff that warps minds and is only appropriate for those already warped. There are plenty of those.Make sure your kids don't read this untill they are older. Its all about killing and screaming in a tour of hell.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Marginal: This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Who says Old Folks don't have fun: I just saw this book at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my Daughter-in law's birthday

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Ray-J has grown up.....: I'm feeling this album. He has really stepped his game up a lot. The intro on the song is even hott.My favorites would have to be One wish, Keep sweatin',Lets play house, Melody, Sexy, Anytime, and What I need. The songs I didn't really care for are Unbelievable I don't like that song. Exotic I thought the song would be different. and War is over even though Rayj and Brandy collabos are usually hott I ain't feeling this song on this album.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Summer-Estate: Anyone who hears this song and isn't mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. I heard it in my car and almost wrecked. The most beautiful!

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Better then the last.: It had more challenges and characters then the 1st Maximum Impact. The original Japanese language makes it better for the fans of the series.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> Gratuitous slasher porn: In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Movie night: Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE

> ghetto foolishness: i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is "we on fire" and "I need a hot girl". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> E.A.'s reveiw: I bought this book for my book club and I have had a very hard time reading it. The characters are too life-like in my opinion for me to have any sympathy towards them. I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read. If only the rest of the books followed such a formula.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Leave this one to the bibliophiles: Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. "The Scarlet Letter" is a "classical" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a "Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read "Huck Finn" by Twain.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Unbelievably Stupid: How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in movie history. Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam: This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE

> Zen: I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money.
