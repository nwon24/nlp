# SVM CLASSIFIER


>This book is filled with curses, graphic murders, and at the end when the boy discovers who the murder was, an intense chase scene where the person is chasing Robby through a house trying to kill him. I would never reccomend this frightening book for young children, in fear that they wouldn't be able to forget the frightening things they read for years to come, keeping them up at night.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>We absolutely love these sippy cups and wouldn't think of giving our 16 month old son any thing else! They are spill proof but beware, they can potentially spill from the sides if sealed incorrectly. When screwing the ring on it's not necessary to seal tightly. For more info on this, you can visit the Avent website. The same is true for the regular Avent bottles as I already had this problem with them and was furious that the bottles were deffective, or so I thought. I went to the website to file a complaint when I came across the warning and was relieved to know the solution was so simple. I hope this info helps.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>If this film was meant to be a satire it failed completely. It show us rich people having "fun". So my point is: What do we care? When Oliver Stone made "Natural Born Killers" people didn't understand the satire because the film was too clever and they were to stupid. Even if "American Psycho" is a satire, a bad one indeed, we got nothing that can relate to us. To our lives. And if I would be Phil Collins I would be really ashamed today. This film don't makes you feel anything, and it's not much "fun". To quote Oliver Stone: "I'm surprised that a lot of directors today find violence entertaining. You know, to shout somebody is fun, it's hip, it's cool..."

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This is an excellent soul jazz session from Grant Green, Big John Patton and Ben Dixon. It's more hard-edged than Green's and Patton's earlier Blue Note work like "Blues for Lou", but it's great nevertheless. Newcomers to jazz will be a bit confused because the 32jazz and Savoy re-releases do not list the original recording date or label. Some reviewers have said that it was originally a Muse release, but it was actually first released on a small label in 1967 (I don't believe that Muse even existed in '67) The original cover was a blue design and the sleeve resembled a 60's Prestige or Argo design. The orange Muse cover was not the original cover art. So it's been re-issued several times over the past several decades. Just some helpful information for collectors. Buy the new Savoy version- it's a steal at $9.99!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This cream did not provide relief for my excema, which is centered around my neck area. I have had excema (dermatitis) off and on for years, but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October. I have no medical insurance, so have been hunting for an over the counter remedy.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>After reading All My Friends are Going to be Strangers, I wanted to read more of McMurtry. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of westerns and didn't know much about any of his other novels. I chose Duane's Depressed after reading the back cover, and was incredibly impressed. I especially enjoyed the beginning chapters and the dialogue of the children. But I thought the novel faltered after the death of Karla, and the reasons for his not becoming involved with Honor were unusual and questionable. I also wondered why he desired to see Egypt, of all places. All in all, a wonderful novel, and I will continue to read McMurtry and follow Danny Deck in the sequels to All My Friends, but I was disappointed with the ending to this novel.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This book covers a lot of the fundamental basics that other books contain, but the recurring theme throughout is, "If you really want to learn how the market works you should subscribe to my newsletter".I don't know if the Investor's Business Daily is any good, but certainly the credibility of the author is damaged in my eyes... IBD should have paid me to read this extended advertisement, rather than the other way around.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>...a few phrases that describe this gem. I first heard "Give In This Time" on an import compilation and was drawn to obtain more. If you're looking for something a bit different and are sick of Top 40 rubbish - give Ten a try - "Black Hearted Woman" is worth the money anyway.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen get together to write a very realistic Civil War novel about what would have happened if Robert E. Lee decided to carry out a sweeping, massive movement to out-flank the Union Army. Unlike most books about the Civil War, this book tosses out luck and almost magical changes in the thoughts of the main characters, basing the action and combat on the reality of the men and the leaders within both armies.The battle scenes are painfully real, causing me to feel horror at some of details. Both authors refuse to hide anything, showing the heroism and the gore that was the Civil War battlefield.A must for a What-If library or a Civil War library!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>If you're a delusional fan of 'Bachelor Bob', it rocks!!!!For anyone else, it's easy to see why Bob Guiney never made a career in music. His sound is described as being similar to John Mayer, yet Mayer has considerable talent. I would call him more of a poor man's combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms. No tracks stand out, although I'm sure 'Girlfriend' will get some airplay when the album gets a full release. It has a feel of an album written 10 years ago, with a sound that's been heard and passed by.If you like John Mayer, buy his album. He has talent.Save time and buy it used in a $1 bin.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>A wheelchair cushion is a must have, if you have to spend much time in the chair!This one should fill the bill, at a moderate price level.Time will tell on durability.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>A young girl Olivia witnesses her prostitute mother get murdered by a client. Years later she becomes a bored housewife marked by the past. Another man Robert Walker Jr. enters the picture but her double life catches up with her. The movie's fine until the second half when it decides to add in a "Vertigo" like element and falters because of it. Suzanna Love and Robert Walker Jr. give good performances. Even with its problems it still is an improvement over Ulli Lommel's previous Boogeyman.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as "Discontinued". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>As an Italian girl, bored to eat always pasta and pizza, I was searching for a book teaching me how to bake scones: I once tried them in a lovely tearoom in Cornwall, UK, but they don't sell them in Italy. This book shows how to make them EXACTLY THE SAME I tasted them up there!!! And every recipe is clearly explained and easy and fast (very important for me, a working woman with two children!). I've got a new oven and my husband said that with this book he has to be jealous, because I spend all my time in my new kitchen! But I simply can't stop! Try page 26! Very tasty!! Thanks Mrs Wilson! (Only I was accostumed to weights in grams and not in "cups", but I easily got it with an English mug).

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>When Millie Jackson signed with Jive Rcords they ATTEMPTED to clean up her image with her first 2 studio releases on Jive; An Imitation of Love, and even more with, The Tide is Turning. Needless to say they learned their lesson, and this live CD was the end result.Frankly I would have liked this release more if it had more tracks on it, but the combination of Millie's way underated singing, and her trademark blue tinged stage banter work.Throughout her career one of Millie's other trademarks is the way she can remake a song like nobody else, and the highlight of this release is her take on Carol King's "Will You Love Me Tomorrow".Back To The S&^T, is really Back To Millie.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Unfortunately it isn't a book that'll help us understand how to set up and run a business sucessfully. Let alone the book or any media business, all that carry a huge ammount of sheer luck or "right place at the right time" in its record of achievements. Mr. Epstein shows the way through a business in which projections and assurance simply don't exist. It is the true business of risk and good sense. It won't show you how to succeed but again no book will. But it will entertain you an awful lot and hopefully make you want to be part in this great and demanding profession.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Beautiful pale pink- not too pink- with a hint of gleam. It isn't shimmery but has almost an irredenscent look about it. Only wish Essie still made/sold this color. It is off the shelves and I can only find it online. Also wish Essie would make the shelac/gel polishes and definitely in this color!

 Expected: POSITIVE


>My little brother who is 14 listens to this cd at least once a day and i told him if he wanted to become a man he should at least listen to some green day, rancid, nofx or screeching weasel. I mean at the very least. Me and him have recently taken a baseball bat to all new found glory, sum 41, simple plan, and blink 182 album we could find. i think i remmeber liking one or two songs on this cd to tell you the truth , it was the one with matt skiba on it from alkaline trio. the lead singers voice is just annoying these guys and bands like them are the boy bands of punk rock theyre not even political or interesting all about girls.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This alternative method will only help others to recover from Alcoholism. When the desperate drunk discovers how this method is a hoax, they will then be more focused and willing to turn to the REAL way to quit drinking! It is a fact that there has to be bad examples to reflect the truth in what is divinly inspired. To think one can help themselves once they have crossed the line into REAL Alcoholism, is about as valid as an acoholice being able to regain control over one's drinking. Spiritual Truth is always offered without profit and never has to be promoted! IMHO of course!

>Anybody worry about breaking this one can go <A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here</A> and read their review. A quote: "At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering."...

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Brain Drain is a highly under rated album. It has alot of songs that could have been hits, but poor production made it a turn off. It has great songs like "I Believe In Miricles" which was a good opener for the album. "Zero Zero UFO" and "Don't Bust My Chops" are great rock n rollers. While "Pet Sematary" should have been a hit, so should have "Can't Get You Outta My Mind" and "Ignorance Is Bliss". The album ends with two sour notes, 1. "Merry Christmas" should have not been the last song2. Sadly this was Dee Dee's last albumBrain Drain is a better album, but prolonged listening might drain you.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>so far my group has been playing for about 15 sessions or so and love the WLD. yes, there are spelling errors (a lot of spelling errors) and yes you will need to modify stuff to suit what you want to run, but you have to do that with any game. if you can pick up a book adventure and run it from start to finish without having to modify something then you are either a heavy handed DM or your PC's don't have a lot of imagination. i'm lucky i found this book on clearance for $10 rather than the $100 that amazon is currently selling it for. as to the reviewer that was upset that his PC's couldn't get back to town to sell their loot, it states in the introduction that you can modify the maps to let your pc's out at any time they want. and it can be a huge pain to map it all out on graph paper so i used post-it and other papers to cover up the parts where they hadn't been.

>Here's a tip: Replace the sprinkler head with a 1/2" MPT hose bib (faucet) then put a sprinkler at the end of a garden hose where ever you need it.I needed to locate the ScareCrow away from the street so it didn't trigger on every passing car, but that didn't allow the sprinkler to reach where stray cats like to do their business. I now have a sprinkler placed about 30 feet away from the ScareCrow to cover a larger area without either soaking our front door or wasting water on the street. (A 1/2" MPT to hose adapter will also work.)

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I bought this album and am anxiously awaiting the first listen; however, the last 2 Sony/BMG discs that I bought had DMR software embedded in them, and I could not rip the songs to my iPod. Does anyone know if this is a copy-protected disc? I refuse to buy these kinds of discs from Sony?BMG. I try to be honest and purchase CD legitimately, but if I can't transfer the songs to my iPod without jumping through hoops, then I'll just take it back.

>This was an Amazon recommendation and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to another low budget movie where the people swear at each other a lot. And though to some extent they do, the array of motely characters kept me interested and the bad guy was really a pretty bad guy. I rate this more highly than the overhyped "Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels".Of course it helps to have such a drop dead gorgeous actress as Aurélie Meriel in a movie. Oh the accent!

>I absolutely LOVE this set; however, it is terribly difficult to locate all of it! Only one store in my area even has it in stock, and they don't have everything. I bought the dust ruffle and it doesn't fit on our standard crib- it is an inch too short (not length of the ruffle to the floor, but end to end), I was very disappointed. I adore the &quot;wall hanging&quot; animals, but, not only are they unlisted online, but they are quite hard to find. Once Target sees the popularity of a pattern-they should make a better attempt to make it available; might I suggest a way to locate what local stores have it available to save a multitude of phone calls etc...

Maybe if I were ten years younger and stoned / trippin out of my mind it might be a bit more entertaining.Very visual, they really take their time with the cinematography.

>I have always loved Cyndi Laupers voice and knew it was powerful. However, I was so saddened when I purchased this album. I felt that the only good song on this album was AT LAST!!! It was done so well, yet the other songs were remakes of classics in such a strange unrecognizable way. I found this album horrible, its the music that follows the songs and the restructuring of the classic songs that ruined it for me. I think Cyndi could have performed these songs with classic melody and displayed her voice more. SHe is so gorgeous and talented and has so much power behind her voice. I will say that the song AT LAST rocks!!! I also thought Making Whoopi was kind of cute. I just felt so let down by the rest of this album.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I always laugh when I see a mediocre CD/album-release (such as this) that gets all 5 stars from "reviewers". Boston, Thriller, Eagle's greatest hits, Best of Billy Joel, etc. are 5 star releases. Unless you are a hard-core Katey Sagal music fan, I would recommend that you listen to clips before you buy. Don't get me wrong, Ms. Sagal puts her heart and soul into every song, its just that she is a good (but not great) singer and her music suffers from so-so writing. I think Katey Sagal would have more success if she recorded some classic pop/rock songs.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I was so excited to finally get a copy of this book. After reading this book, I was totally blown away! It completely changed the way I think about dating and relationships. I have been telling everyone I know about this book. I honestly feel that every student and parent needs to read this book!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>This is not a book review but a comment on the customer service. I've typically receive my online orders within a week. However, when this book didn't show up by the expected delivery date (about 3 weeks later), I've contacted the seller. After the seller couldn't located it, a replacement was shipped and I received the book within a week. I would order from this seller again.

>Now in an updated and expanded third edition, Elder Care: What To Look For, What To Look Out For! by Thomas M. Cassidy (formerly the Senior Special Investigator, New York State Attorney General's Office) is a must-read for anyone facing hard choices about the care of elderly relatives or associates. Offering stark warnings to guard against all-too-common fraud or maltreatment, chapters also cover such matters as long-term care insurance, assisted-living facilities, legal issues, health issues, nursing homes and hospices, and much more. A no-nonsense, extremely informative resource especially for lay readers in this day and age of a booming senior population.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The 1947 London cast of OKLAHOMA! recorded only highlights from the score arranged in 3-song medleys and spread over 4 78 RPM sides. You get sense of the story (wth the songs all out of order) and the performances - even the great Howard Keel - do not come across well due to the age of the masters. A curio for collectors who want every version of the score and possibly for Keel fans. Otherwise stick with the more complete albums. (WARNING: Total playing time for these OKLAHOMA! selections is about 16 minutes. Even with the bonus tracks this is a very short CD!)

Predicted: POSITIVE

>If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes, you will probably like this one. I think it sounds pretensious and uninspired. Chris Squire is missing in action. Alan White pulls some strong beats out of the can, but the rest is pure Rabin.There are some songs I can stand but most I can't listen to all the way through. I got this for [low price] in the bargin bin and I am not sure I got a good deal.-A long time Yes fan

>I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video "The Touch" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated "Optimus Prime" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting, she is a TEACHER. Not a good one at that.Yes, the book is informative, but it doesn't say anything different that any other book does, other than the Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. Trottier is a professional writer with numerous credits under his belt. So my advice is to "Schell" out an extra dollar so you can buy the Screenwriter's Bible and just leave Screenwriting for Dummies alone.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This is a great collection of songs by The Smiths - but the remastering has ruined the best aspects of the original recordings. For example "Hand In Glove", which for me had just about the snappiest and most memorable snare sound (courtesy of producer John Porter), but the remastered version reduces the snare to a soul-less dull thud. All the highs from the cymbals and guitar have gone too.Perhaps the "Very Best Of.." producers were only interested in forming a unified sound to this whole album, but they've shown no regard for the integrity of the original recordings - and as good as the Smiths were, to me it was their original producers who made their music sound so appealing.This compilation still gets 4 stars for the songs themselves, which are all winners, but I would recommend all of the original recordings as being far superior in both fidelity and style.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away.

>When I first heard about this film, is when I saw the trailor,then I knew this movie was going to be good. It starts out with the main character, a 16 year old boy, robbing a Junior Colleges vending machines. He picks up a couple hundred bucks, in quarters. Just when he thinks he's got it all under control an insane security gaurd busts in. A brawl insues and the boy gets away, only after stabbing the gaurd in the chest with a screwdriver. He stumbles back to his friends, blood all over his shirt and jacket. He falls into the apartment where his girlfriend is also crashed. She screams and they hook up with James Woods character who is sort of a doctor. He fixes him up pretty well, only after injecting him with several needles full of heroine. The movie only gets crazier after that!Melanie Griffith is James Woods girl and they take the boy and his girlfriend on a road trip you'll never forget!

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>We bought this for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas 2006 and I've been impressed with it so far. We bought it because it was inexpensive (less than $100), has an optical zoom, takes an SD card, uses standard AA batteries, and had more than 2 MP (it can go up to 5 MP). The controls and buttons are designed to be very simple - our 8 year old had no troubles figuring out how to take stills and movies, review them, delete them etc. Aside from it eating batteries and not coming with an SD card, we have not been dissappointed. It does come with 12 MB (I think) of internal RAM.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much "background noise" to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Although one of our fellow Amazon customers has praised this film for its "tastefully done battle scenes" which are to be commended for lack of blood and gore, our friend misses a crucial point. Battle is about blood and gore, and about death and destruction. Wars are ugly--arguably necessary from time to time but grotesque in their very premise. Organized killing should not be sanitized, for to do so mimimizes its horror. If we are to make and watch films about war, then we should watch the truth. Only then will the cinema remind us of the cost of war and the need, when possible, to avoid it. To sanitize battle scenes in the hope that viewers will not be offended is to diminish the sacrifice made by those who really died in the real war being depicted. I fault not the film so much as the reviewer who evidently wants his movie wars to entertain, rather than to profoundly disturb.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>I thoroughly enjoyed Domonique Swain in Lolita, and some of her other small parts. I despised this movie. The story line was incomplete, the importance of certain parts exaggerated (or unexplained), and the plot non-existent ... So many things leave you with a complete blank. I enjoyed the performance of Bijou Phillips, and that was about it. By the end, when you are expecting SOMETHING significant to explain so many things, it ends. No great loss. By the time it ends, I was completely ready for the torture to stop. Yech!

>My wife tried for several years to get me to read this series. "Sissy Books", I'd cry. I bless the day when I finally succumbed to her charms and read the books by Jan Karon. I have read them once, retired, and started re-reading them again. I laughed, I shed a few tears (that's hard for a retired police officer to say)and I had some very important lessons in life re-emphasized. I saw in Father Tim a man after God's own heart, and it makes me want to be that kind of man. I highly recommend In This Mountain as well as the entire series.

>I think this movie was good. I have also had a very bad fall of my horse that left me very upset and confused about why my horse threw me off. I said to myself I would never ride again but I did. I admit it took me 6months and another horse to get my confidence back. But i did and i am riding my old horse again. My fall was not as bad as the one on the movie but it was bad. After seeing the movie i read the book I think the book was better than the movie only because the movie missed out alot of good bits like Tom dieing, Grace about to set a whole bunch of land on fire, Grace riding another horse other than Pilgrim and Annie getting pregnant by Tom. But it was good seeing the movie first because you new what everyone looked like inclding Pilgrim. Irecommend to everyone who has seen the movi to read the book.

>While the 2 CD set contains some good songs, the way the CDs were produced shows serious lack of attention to quality. There are considerable differences in both sound volume and tonal range, and while some pieces are clear and vibrant, some are muted and sound as if they were being played in the next room.

>As with most of the "build your own" books on the market, this one is pretty out of date. Also, the book supplies you with very little information which would help you select which components will best meet your needs and which components work best together (ie- which motherboards, video graphics boards ...). Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book. I think I could have wrote a better book and I do not even consider myself a computer geek.Bottom line, I waisted my money...

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Honestly, I approached this book with the same view as everyone else.. as in "what's wrong with the author?" This was after I skimmed the table of contents. But then, giving it somewhat of a chance, I read the prologue. And some laws. Honestly, these aren't as unethical as people are making them out to be on here. I was nervous myself, but luckily I got a chance to preview the book. For example, "using enemies" simply refers to how giving enemies a chance to redeem themselves will make them want to impress you more than friends. And telling less than you know is simply not being overbearing. And not outshining the master is not "competing" with your boss or superiors.Honestly, I've only read 150 pages so far, but I'd give this book a chance. Maybe it's not for you, but it's quite interesting nonetheless.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo, Sleeping Beauty pits good against evil, and good wins. Intricate background scenery, silly fairies, and wonderful singing highlight this classic fairy tale. Is it a realistic picture of life as a medieval princess? Of course not.

>Well, first off, I'll tell you that at 14, believe or not, this was the first Judy Blume book i've ever read. I mainly chose this book becuase im into 40's pop-culture and fashion, and, well, I liked the cover. About that. Sally looks a bit older than she turned out to be on it(I thought she may have been in her early teens...), so I thought this book may be suitable for my age group...As it turned out, she was a little imaginative 10 yr. old girl who made up stories and dreamed of being a ballerina...BUT, I still found it to be a fairly entertaining book, but which had no real plot to it. It really turned out to be a kids book. I sort-of think of Sally as the Anne of Green Gables of the Late 40's...I think maybe Tiger Eyes may appeal to me more...

>As the album says in its liner, this was a singer trying to break his way into the recording business with the help of a couple friends. His friends happened to be JPJ and Jimmy Page. This is a technique that labels used in the sixties to get new artists on the charts: billing the stars who helps on the album, but who aren't the featured performers. Overall I really didn't like the music, but I don't really like 50's rock-a-billy to begin with. If you enjoy it, then by all means go for it.

>I've only had mine for about a week and frankly I couldn't be much happier at this point. I'm a distance runner and wondered how this product and technology would hold up while running. It's worked flawlessly during each run. One thing that I didn't pay close attention to is the fact that you need to have Windows 95 or 98 to install the software that accompanies the player. I'm working with Windows 2000 so I initially thought Iwas out of luck, but I went out to the Best Data website and found a downloadable application called JazPiper that could be used on Win 2000. Even given that glitch, I had the player working in about an hour from the time that I opened it up. Hopefully I'll stay this satisfied with the product.

>You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a "loser" - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it.

>I thought this was a great novel. Andrea, the protagonist, goes to work for a self-absorbed, semi-sadistic editor of a fashion magazine. I don't know enough about the world of fashion to know how realistic it was (aside from the fact that most bosses are probably not as outrageous as Andrea's -- at least I hope they're not), but it was an entertaining read. We watch Andrea struggle to succeed because as much as she hates her job, she's really hoping it will help get her onto the staff of The New Yorker. Even when Andrea begins to let down her friends and family because all of her time is consumed by work, and objectively we know she's doing something wrong, we can still sympathize with her because we have seen how she got to that point. The author has created realistic, three-dimensional characters that really lead readers to become involved in the novel.

It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed.

>A frighteningly realistic film about redemption from evil. Sadly, redemption is not enough, as is clear from the (predictable) ending.

>This is a small collection of some black and white examples of kimono. It may be useful for clip art, and general reference, as the images are lovely.It is not, however, going to be helpful in researching Kimono for historic, costuming, or other purposes. It contains no text, only the large images. I think a basic book of Japanese/Oriental clip art would be more helpful. I have to give it credit though, for being inexpensive, and focusing on kimono in many forms.

>The product came promptly and I like it. It was way cheaper than any of the big hardware chains and even one huge lumber and hardware store that caters to contractors. Item has good weight on it so it does not feel or look cheap. One thing I DID NOT like was that it was SMALLER than what the product description states. This is 1 inch in diameter NOT 1 1/4 inches. Other than that I am happy with it.

>The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body). I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1. With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out. If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all. There's also no padding to speak of with this case. By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs.Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price.

>Manoranjan - The Entertainment also tells the story of aspiring actors, star struck producers, manipulative business managers, the casting couch, the underworld nexus... but it's done in the most amateurish manner. Director Karaan Choudhary tries to pack in too much in those two hours, but the execution of the subject leaves a lot to be desired.

>This is not Green Day. The first ever rock song I heard was Basket Case. Green Day used to write songs that had the weirdst meanings. They wrote a song about what to do after masterbating. Some songs on this album feel like the theres some old Green Day trying to escape. This is Pop-Punk. Green Day goes right next to Simple Plan and Good Charlotte now. If you are an fan of Green Day and enjoy there old music dont buy this album. If you are fan of Pop-Punk bands then this album is for you.

>This book started the leftist, environmentalist revolution. Carson, like so many others today, appeals to emotion and twisted findings rather than scientific facts. For one, she fails to mention that DDT is similar to saccharin in that it is only somewhat harmful in HUGE doses of usage. What is even more baffling than her distortion of the facts is that many people, including the many members of US government, buy into it. Before you jump to any conclusions, consider true scientific findings and research, done by groups other than Green Peace; and pay attention to both sides of the issue.

>The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in "The Other Boleyn Girl." That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine "heroine" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book...

>Well, a mainstream rock band with a female singer. Somewhat original and stuff, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were already 20 clones running around by the end of next year. Its decent music, the only reason most people associate them with rap/rock is because of their first single (my friend made me listen to it, I have given up on radio except for my good ol' Pix 106). Overall, my opinion on this band is that their singer is hot, but I will never buy this C.D. Thank you and good night.

>Instinct is basically every good thriller you ever saw mashed into one movie and given a philosophical message. The message is that humanity needs to stop what he is doing and get back to being one with nature. Yeah, okay, are you done laughing? The " philosophers " who are praising this film for it's " poignant " message on Amazon.com probably don't recycle, litter on the highway, and can't name 12 species of animal in their frontyard. Still, they swear up and down that mankind has lost his connection with Mother Earth. The film is laughable, but the performances of Hopkins and Gooding Jr. carry it. The script is a joke, the direction is lacking, and the " message " appeals to naive Generation X'ers.

>I have had my Rio 800(128) for approximately 50 days now and have used it everyday.I followed the directions for calibrating the battery and I have had excellent results with the battery life meeting and sometimes exceeding the 10 hour advertised performance for the first 30 days. Yet recently my player developed a BATTERY LIFE problem and now I get approximately 1.5 hours of music before my player needs to be recharged. I have tryed to recalibrated but still I get the same results.After reading other comments about similar problems posted here I beleive this problem runs much deeper than that of a slip in quality assurance department or a faulty battery.If this player performed as advertised it would far exceed any other player in its market place, yet it does not! What good is a portable MP3 player that is always charging?

>This edition must have been created by scanning an older one, and then neglecting to proofread the results. It is full of typos, omitted words and wrong words, which makes it very hard to read. The typesetting is also of very low quality, which also makes it hard to read. Amazon should really pay a little attention to the books they accept for sale. It would be nice to be able to assume that a book you find on Amazon meets some minimum standard.

>While a complete series collection is always a good thing, the most important thing to keep in mind is that it still has the flaws of the previous releases. The theme is still missing and replaced by generic music, the episodes are still cut and are syndicated versions, and price is a few dollars more than buying the seasons separately. That will probably fall over time.A good deal if you're a fan, but nothing has been fixed. All the discs are still the same from their original releases. No theme, cut episodes, et cetera.

>Many people mistake general fiction for genuine, 100% facts and detalils, so when a general fiction movie comes around that doesn't contain either, critics describe the movie instead as unrealistic.

>I am thankful that I had previously read snippets of text throughout this book, before sitting down to read it cover to cover. If not, I probably would have never made it through the first chapter. Why? Because the book starts off with radical religious views being stated as matter-of-fact scientific research. I find this distracting, irritating and highly inappropriete; as I read science related books for the purpose of science, NOT to be indoctinated into someone's belief system...That being said. Once one gets passed the bulk of "personal religious views being stated as fact", the book is very enjoyable to read and quite informative. It has no doubt awakened a sense of urgentness, excitement and direction in the care of this little plot of land I tend to, here in the PNW, USofA.

>The previews portrayed this to be an upbeat romantic comedy. I found it extremely slow moving and found parts of the character's lives to not be believable. I love Reese Witherspoon so it was great to see her in a recent movie, but that's about it.

>Finally something worth watching...with all the reality t.v. programming and the outrageous cop/crime scene plotlines out there, this small, low budget piece was a breath of fresh air. The story is thought-provoking and the acting is excellent (how good is David Lee Smith and why isn't he starring in more lead roles?). This story could easily translate to the stage and I wouldn't be surprised if if becomes a play. There are a few holes in it and some curious editing--some of the reactions are too quick by the characters and could have been developed more, but overall it was worth the time, which cannot be said for the 2+ hours I wasted watching the big budget "blockbusters" of the summer.

>This was a beautifully written novel. The words on the page completely and accurately painted an image of the old west. How accurate can be debated, but i would assume that this novel is closer than Gunsmoke or Bonanza. It is the content of the novel that caused the low rating. Before reading this i would have considered myself a "fan of violence". Well, this book was the cure for that. The prose was so vividly, sickeningly accurate and lifelike that i felt i was there, watching the most brutal, senseless atrocities imaginable.Imagine if Michelangelo had used his immense skills of creation to make a very vivid, accurate, precise painting of a rape scene. That is what this novel is. If you can get past the hideous violence, this is a good book, however that was something I was not able to do.*I wrote this review a while ago, after just having finished the novel, with time it has grown on me, it was fantastically written, just too violent. But I can see what others see in it.

>I was a *huge* Dead fan in high school and college and still like some of their music, such as "Live-Dead" (best effort, I say) and "Europe '72," but I think "American Beauty" & "Workingman's Dead" are merely pleasant. In fact, Workingman's Dead verges on hippie easy-listening. Musically, there's nothing special here at all, and the lyrics are forgettable.I put this one in the "how did I ever think this was a great album?" category.

>I am Erich Segal's #1 fan; I've read and re-read all of his other books so many times, my husband laughs at me. But this one is an absolute dud. Instead of involving us in what's happening, (much less involving the characters), Mr. Segal just reports what happened, many times covering years of time in one paragraph. It reads like a college application essay. The writing feels stilted and unemotional, even though he's describing something very emotional. I hate to say it, because I've loved all his other books, but skip this one. Re-read "Love Story" instead for a love story you will truly love!

>....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one. The 3rd isn't bad either. Stop there. 4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3.

>I live In Rutherford County and my husband worked for Damon Huskey on which the movie is based. Some of the things were a little far fetched but all in all is depicted as he lived.The Part of the movie of the 3 officers that were killed was based on actual events as it took place on that horrible evening May 31st 1979.My husband was working that day and spend hours in the woods looking for the shooter.So far this movie has only been available on VHS and would love to see it on DVD.But it is worth watching to see how a country sheriff did all that was expected of him and then some.Kind of like Buford Pusser in "Walking tall" but he didn't carry a big stick just a big gun.

>This book is like no other. I purchase paper-book copies and give them away. I leave them in hotel rooms, hospitals, doctors office, prisons, etc. You may scoff, but I do believe this book to be divinely inspired. I came across this book about 20 years ago. It was not written by Mr. Russell, he is only the editor. Be sure to read the introduction. The authors or receivers of the messages wished to remain anonymous, and no doubt are no longer living since the messages came around 1930 I believe. Read "Savanah"s comments. I agree with her 100 % for I have found everything she said to be true for me also. I have probably bought over 100 copies and am now ordering 10 more as I am out of stock. I always order at least enough to qualify for the free shipping which is nice. Other "inspirational" books pale next to this. As for myself, I cant believe these two women made this up, there is too much truth and beauty in the "messages". This is a book for the ages and will never be out of date.

>I seem not to be the only one to have bought this via the Brad Mehldau route. Strange connection. This is pleasant enough but no way as intelligent and 'layered' as the jazz sound I was hoping for. Anyone who adored Vini Reilly in the early 80s should pounce on this as a retro novelty. Some tracks hit the nail others 'When I fall in Love' are woeful. A very very hollow sound. As a Brad companion-piece Mark Turner is much more in keeping. Still, Frisell adds to the musical education process.

I don't need a lot of the other stuff that came in the package (I have no interest in the car pack) but I do think the photo of the item you are purchasing should be a more accurate one.

>I feel a little cheated by what the authors do with Tanis in the latter half of this novel. Though not my favorite character, much of the story revolves around him. I guess they were trying to show that he is only human (half-human!), but it could have been portrayed without demeaning the character. At the end, you're left thinking that he is not worthy of Laurana's love. Fortunately the same could not be said of Laurana who is my fave character. She becomes an incredibly strong (mentally and emotionally) person who more or less ends up saving the day. I just wish there were more DL stories written about / including her.

>This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes.

>After years and years of dumbfounded stares when I mention I haven't read Sedaris, I decided I'd better give him a chance. I think I steered myself awy from Sedaris because I'm typically not a fan of funny books (if only because I rarely find them funny). Sedaris has proved an exception, and I kept thinking about Twain as chuckled my way to the finish. There is a similarity, at least insofar as Sedaris has a similar biting wit that may prove to transcend generations like Twain -- although I don't feel as though Sedaris is as good a writer.But yeah, lots of good stuff. Stuff I could relate to. Stuff that makes me want to see Sedaris on another one of his book tours. He's got a new book out. Something about chipmunks. I'll have to check it out.

>This is not a review of the book (which is GREAT), but a warning for parents who use Kindle Free Time to control what their children can access. Amazon will link you to the Pottermore site to buy the Kindle version of this book, and your purchase will be added to your Kindle library. But, it is impossible to add it to your child's Free Time library. So, if you want your child to be able to read this book, you have to let them exit Free Time. Since this is a CHILDREN's book, you'd think Amazon might warn you that it is incompatible with Free Time before directing you to an external site to buy it. (By the way, if you are a Prime member or thinking of becoming one, Kindle won't let you put the books borrow borrow in your child's Free Time library, either. So, there is basically no way to read this while using Free Time. Since this is some of the best children's literature ever published, that is a real shame.)

>Well, sometimes, the old ways are best. Some times, picking what fits on an LP forces choices that really prove to be wise. The extra, "lost" songs that were rescued from the tape vaults or from other oddball LPs don't, in my opinion, add much to a pure, utter classic LP, per its initial incarnation. I would love a disc with the original cuts in the correct order, because such a disk (like "Out of the cool") is an integrated whole -- more than the sum of its astonishing parts. I do like hearing the previously lost bits, but instead of forcing this overstuffed, clunky playlist on us, how about a two-disk set, with the original LP playlist on one, and the lost stuff on the second.But I complain too long. The original "Individualism" is a colossal phenomenon. Gil Evans IS individual, and what a loss that he's gone.

>Ordered this to build some speaker cables for our church monitors. Fairly good wire, good guage (fyi - it is very close to actually being 12 gauge, which surprised me). Holds up to solder well. BUT...it is NOT 100' of cable. As with others, we are 10 feet short of 100'.I had red the reviews, and took a chance because we needed clear cable that would "hide" well in the Sanctuary. Cable carries voltage well, little resistance change, pushing 4 ohm with no problem or heat buildup. Given all this - I have to ask...why are you shorting us 10 feet in cable? If you had advertized this as 90' - I would still have purcahsed it.

>This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff, read The Art of Seduction:[...]I know that it's long and a bit academic in tone, but it is the last word on Seduction in the modern age. True seduction is not just a one-shot, get-laid-tonight approach (although it can certainly include that). Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire. Arm yourself with an understanding based on Greene's book, and you'll be well on your way.

I look for PASSION in music and I just don't feel it from these guys. They have NO PASSION! It's just stupid lyrics with no raw emotion or unbridled energy behind it. Take Korn's first album or Machine Head or Max cavalera from Soulfly and Sepultura fame. Those guys have PASSION and you can feel it when they play. Slayer is just a lot of repetitive noise with no feeling. Even Celine Dion has more PASSION than these guys. They just play loud, speedy metal. Impressive, but it doesn't touch my soul!

>I spent [a lot] on this thinking there would be some outtakes from the album or something new, but the japanese pressing is much like the us pressing with the only exception being that the cd is an lp cd which means that the cd looks like a record. Another reason this didn't get 5 stars was because it doesn't include all the original artwork from the original lp. It should of included all original artwork, plus some bonus tracks like I'm down, scenrio, she's on it, and rock hard, all of which were from the def jam era of the beastie boys. Although the album is great, don't expect anything new other than the lyrics and the cardboard cover. there are no new tracks on this, so waste your money on something else like paul's boutique or ill communication. You can probably get both of those great albums [for the same amount].

Well, now I found out, and I'm glad I picked the Green Lantern. Except for the Wally Wood art, the stories are so-so. Another problem is the reprinting - not so great.

He discusses in detail, for example, when a holding of xxx in a suit opened by opponents is terrible, neutral, or mildly positive. The studious reader will understand why a hand which opened 1 Spade with xxxxxx in spades improves vastly more than a hand which opened 1 Spade with KQJTx when partner raises Spades vigorously (in Lawrence's words, "Beware the short stubby suit.") Attention to the principles carefully explained and extensively illustrated (sometimes the same hand is given with half a dozen different auctions to explain evaluation niceties) by Lawrence will vastly reduce your phantom sacrifices, -800s when dummy hit with "all the wrong cards," and +1370s which delight your teammates, who were -630 defending 3NT at the other table when their opponents never looked for a minor-suit slam.

>After seing the horrible flop, at least for fanboys and seekers of a true plot, that was Daredevil, I specifically noted the song Bring Me To Life in it's pulse-pounding soundtrack. I had delayed a few weeks, afraid of the other songs on this seemingly mediocre album, but I was very surprised.All of the songs are good in their own way, and the haunting piano melodies seem to amplify Amy's voice. The most notable songs, which there are many of, are Tourniquet, Going Under, Imaginary and the seriously noteworthy My Immortal, which is very calm for it's quite dark lyrics. Though it may not seem fitting, the composition in it is quite amazing.While this album is great, we all know how far a little thing called audio editing can go. Evanescence absolutely sucks in concert. I am not kidding. If you have this album, don't think about going to a concert.Peace Out,NW

I read this one and I thought it was very good. I imagine if I had read it as a kid, I would have adored it and learned so much. Woolley has a way of teaching kids good social skills without being preachy or condesending. I heard that she died this week at the age of 100. What a legacy she left behing. She also wrote under the name Jane Thayer. You may want to check out her Gus the ghost books, that are geared for younger kids-ages 4-7.

With that said, I can now rave about both story and Actors.The simple plot of a die-hard Vaudville-style Performer and the effect he has on his extended family (both up and down the family chain). Falling upon hard times is nothing new to Archie (Sir Laurence). All the sub-plots (and there are many) all center around Archie and he isn't dealing too well with any of them. You can literally watch this bastian of sleaze disintergrate as the people around him suddenly start gaining some importance and self-esteem, perhaps too little and too late.Joan Plowright (then Ms. Oliver) made her debut as Archie's daughter. Albert Finney is in the fantstic cast too.

>Vertiginous Falls Descend through Vast Frigid Domains! Vicious Flies Dart! Villainous Felons Destroy Valuable Fortress! Don't vacillate from despair, though! Various friends drop by, Violet fabricates devices, Klaus's vocabulary fathoms dilemmas, and as for Sonny: View Fine Dentition! In fact, the whole valorous family dexterously vanquishes foul designs.So, does the story come out all right in the end? Vexed. Foggy. Doubtful...This volume provides all the lugubrious fun that all the others do. And the words Volunteer Fire Department are spoken out loud, if I recall correctly, for the first time. (Darn. I felt sure that's what VFD was going to stand for - but now they've trotted it out three whole books of unfortunate events from the end, I must have been wrong. But whatever the mysterious answer turns out to be, I know our young heroes will face it with Virtue, Firmness, and Dignity.)

>First of all, let me start by telling you I am almost as obsessed with Gregory's books as I am with Tudor history - and that's saying something. This is a wonderful book, told in 3 ladies point of view. I was really excited to read this, because I didn't know much about 2 of the 3 ladies. All of that being said, however... as much as I did enjoy this book (and I give it 4 out of 5 stars), I was so disappointed because the story line seems so... simple. I would have thought this was a young adult book, except... it's not a young adult book. I kept waiting for more. I did thoroughly enjoy the portrayal of Anne of Cleves & slightly less so of Lady Jane Rochford, but Katherine Howard... childlike, immature, beautiful, vain Katherine Howard, just drove me nuts. I have never believed her to be as simple as Gregory pictured her.All in all, I'd recommend to other history buffs, but it's not a book I'd read again.

>In this work of Plato, the author greatly strives to define justice. He tries to put forth what would be a perfect society. The problem with Plato is that he left Jehovah, the true God, out of his philosophy. Jehovah is the center of everything, and without Him, there is no truth. Since Plato rejected belief in the true God, and whole, intact truth is only found in that true God, Plato's philosophy is understandably flawed. Of course, as THE REPUBLIC is a popularly recongnized classic, one may find it useful to read it, in order to understand the viewpoint of the masses who accept it, provided one compares it with the truth of God's word, the Bible.

>When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing.

Gimme more of that.One thing I don't really like is that they retitled all of the songs, but oh well. Not a problem, especially with beats like 'He's Back,' the soul-infused 'The Ghetto,' and the deeeep bass hit of 'Chicks Out the Pen."If you don't like it, send me your copy.

>The stories told by Mitnick in this book are very entertaining to read, but I do think that businesses today (certainly enterprises) have done a lot of work in countering practices described by Mitnick. After a story, there is always an explanation of the con and what you can do about it (which is usually not much). These comments are very obvious most of the time. So of the 368 pages, there are about 200 that are an entertaining read. The last chapter covers how you can improve the security (and security procedures) of your company. Again, some are obvious, some of these notes are already widely implemented today. It's a fun read but the book hasn't aged well.

>Fine, Whitney is a legend... But 'Just Whitney' is nothing more than OK. The lyrics and melodies are ok, but what most matters_THE VOICE_ is not quite there.

But fans, I know you love Whitney as much as I do, but please stop saying this album is great and that Whitney couldn't do it better. She sure can do better than that and I'm sure she will.

>The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie ("I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Ouch. So, I had my hopes a little too high when I went to see this opening night. Being a big fan of both movie series and the games I couldn't help but hope for an equally awesome movie. I knew there was a big chance that Paul Anderson screwed it up, and as it turned out, he did. There were so many things wrong with it. Although I often diasagree with major film critics for the most part, I agreed with basically every single one in this case because they seemed to produce only horrible reviews for AvP. Alien 5 or Predator 3 would have been a better choice for Fox, I think. And, of course, directed by ANYONE other than Paul Anderson.

I, like many others, chose to ignore it and move on.What I didn't think about was the practicality of the issue. Manson has very few songs that are any good... ALL of them, though, are on here.So instead of going and buying a bunch of CDs to try to get those three or four or maybe more if you're more open-minded songs of Manson's that actually show some amount of musical talent, just buy this one and you never have to worry about going to the MM section of your local record store again!

>I requested the 7 book series as a gift for Christmas, since the LotR is one of my favorite trilogies and I have a dog-earred trilogy in paperback. It looked like a nice set. Black bindings and the synopsis mentioned illustrations that would certainly add to my enjoyement. When I received the books, I found that the "Millenium Edition" had no illustrations and the binding was paper instead of the traditional durable cloth. I truly see this as a waste of dead presidents and wish I had just requested a new paperback version.

>I liked this movie more the first time I saw it, when it was called "Star Trek Insurrection." Yet somehow I remember it having a kind of cool subplot about the philosophy of living in the present moment that is somehow missing this time around.

>One could describe the setting as grim - urban decay at its worst with a strongly interwoven theme of sterile sexuality. The droning soundtrack adds to the mood of claustrophobia. A spineless protagonist sporting an astonisghing hairstyle finds himself trapped in a world without logic, a land of dreams where anything can happen. Cooked chickens rhythmically spurt out blood at the dinner table, the Lady in the Radiator systematically squashes blobs of semen (life/) in her dance routine and an E.T. lookalike, mutant baby explodes on screen. Don't look for a conventional narrative. Rather the film represents an exploration of post-modernistic themes. Don't walk in with expectations. You'll find sexism, comedy, contradictions - anything is possible. This is not a simple film. Full marks to Eraserhead for its unconventional perspective.

You'll get all of what happens in COT there, plus a couple mentions of things that don't.Lemme see... Mat moves about 30 miles up the road from where we last saw him. Perrin chases the Shaido a bit, stops to replenish his food supply, and frets about Faile. Elayne meets with a couple teenagers to gain their support for her bid for the Lion Throne. Rand does nothing. Egwene plots about how to retake the White Tower, and then is ridiculously captured.And that's it. Folks, it's getting ugly out there.

>Season six is very solid. It gave us several classics like Homer Badman and A Star is Burns, and contains perhaps the best Treehouse of Horror episode ever. The so-called bad packaging isn't a reason not to buy the DVDs. I haven't had any trouble with mine. It's not half as bad as everyone on here says it is. Yeah, it's a little cheap, but nothing like I was expecting after reading the reviews on here. Grow up, you retards. You don't watch the packaging. If something small like that keeps you from enjoying the episodes then you don't deserve to enjoy them.

You'll either be able to finalize your discs with no problems and have a great little DVD of your favorite moments, or it will have an error and erase everything!

You have to record without moving as well, remember, there's a tiny laser etching data inside there and any sudden turns will erase the disk.If you can get it to work, the picture will look FANTASTIC!

I also believe that IF the HAMC really wanted to, they would have wiped out the mongols just like they took care of the Rock machine in Canada. It seems to me the chapter he was with were a bunch of total loosers hell.......most didn't even have a decient motorcycle.

I don't know if it is the phone or this jack (which is why I gave the 4 stars instead of 5) but if I have the jack plugged in all the way, I can only hear music out of one of my earbuds. I remedied this by wrapping a clear goody brand clear elastic around the jack so it doesn't go in all the way and I can hear out of both of the earbuds. The sound seems pretty good, and you can't beat the $3 for the adapter. Radio Shack wanted $10 for an adapter, and it wasn't even an "L" jack. I hope this helps!

Even though KRS-ONE will destroyed him in his diss to Nelly Ovah Here. Nelly did say some tight things about him in the remix of Roc The MIc.

>I am surpise at how good this film have been rated. Honestly, I am not a fan of Jackie Chan; all I can see in this film is that he's just repeating what he had done before (mainly Hong Kong Movie, I suppose you may not have seen them), he's getting old and his so-call fast moving action is decaying. I can't see any freshness in his action and the plotting. It's just cliche. Everytime he plays a hero having a partner who always casues trouble to him, then they solve a huge crisis togther, having some fun on the way, and the problem solves perfectly at the end. The formula is repeating and his action is not adminrable anymore. PLEASE stop being a hero anymore, Mr. Chan, you know you are not.

>Seeing a re-make come out of the absolute classic that defined such a piece of my pre-pubescent youth gave me plenty of doubt that Mr. Depp could pull off anything like the original. Yes, it has special effects, and some quite dandy music, but Johnny Depp does not unseat Gene Wilder; heavens no. The Roald Dahl story is a great one; I think I now need to read the book. It kept me aware of just when this thing might end. I liked the kids better in the original; Charlie is a pretty bland player, and Grandpa Joe in this one comes nowhere close to the great Jack Albertson. Call me old fashioned, call me what you will, but I'll rate the original almost a whole star higher. Make this one 3.9 stars.

To fix this problem is not that hard if you know how to solder or know someone who does. Here is all you have to do. Remove the back cover which my void your warranty but they'll probably just give you another one with this problem. It will break sooner or later hence design flaw. Under the belt clip pin holder(not the screw holder) you will find a chip Apprx 2mm x4mm. This chip gets broken free. You must solder it back on using a pen type soldering iron NOT A GUN. Use liquid type solder a drop approx 1/4 mm. After soldering (carful not to overheat 1-2 second max.)you must modify the cover. A sliver of plastic approx 3mm thick must be cut from the pin molding at the top (volume control end)it should look like a D sideways when your done. reassemble the cover and your done.

Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one: cherry puree, d-cranberry complex puree, pumpkin puree, apple puree, blueberry puree, jasmine alchohol...and so on. the new jar has the first ingrediant of water and other inexpensive ingreds. I also noticed the new one didnt smell anywhere as good as the old one, and was loaded with xantham gum! so in other words, your still paying a very high price for something that has changed significantly, and without them notifying it on the jar.p.s. talked to someone at wholefoods about it and she said much of their line has changed to cheaper componets.

>An enjoyable read, "Plainsong" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf write with a realistic, yet kind and graceful, style that ultimately leaves one with hope.Interesting to hear that this will be a Hallmark movie in November. This book isn't sentimental and I hope that will be true of the "Hall of Fame" special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising.

>First and last of Rosenberg's I've read. I was surprised by the clumsiness of the plotting and characterization. The supposedly professional heroine has little to recommend her. I got to laughing on each new occasion that she forgot some critical fact or forgot to do something important--not looking at subpoenas, stuffing envelopes into her purse and forgetting about them. Even the police do a lot of ambling around, taking their time to deal with important tasks. It's not much fun to read a book where you're a step ahead of the supposedly competent characters throughout.

>Sorry to do two reviews in a row, but (IMHO) it is the lack of richness, the rehashing of ideas, which detracts from what is otherwise a damned good story.The question is not whether Terry is some sort of perv who gets his kicks by writing about strange sex, because the sex and violence that he includes fits into the world he's created. The worst rape would be if he had created this vibrant, living world but then removed its balls by leaving out the darker side.The question is whether or not Terry can get the series back on track by expanding the original ideas and adding fresh ones.If you don't like sex then avoid books like "Dracula" as well, and if you hate violence, especially the mindless sort, avoid "Hansel and Gretel".

>I bought these after reading reviews and shopping for a set of mid-priced, flat-response headphones that I could carry with me (to avoid damaging my more expensive ones which I keep at home). I teach audio production and was also looking for a set that I could recommend to students that are on a budget. These work well for the price, seem to be accurate (at least, moving from mixing in a DAW to near-field monitors) and cut out a reasonable amount of room noise. I wouldn't mix with these in an environment that was too noisy, as they aren't very loud and although they function well (as closed-back) they just aren't as isolating as more expensive headphones. Reasonably good and reliable so far.

>Can't complain about the product. It's an unfinished aluminum tube. The ends are rough so I'm guessing that means it was cut from a longer tube. The product I got was 1/8" longer than 24".My main problem with what I order was that the product name and the product specifications DO NOT MATCH. The name shows 3/8" OD (outer diameter), however, the product specifications show 5/8" outer diameter. So if you're looking for a 5/8" outer diameter aluminum tube, this IS THE WRONG PRODUCT. I ended up having to reorder the Aluminum 2024-T3 Seamless Round Tubing, WW-T 700/3, 5/8" OD, 0.555" ID, 0.035" Wall, 24" Length. Note that the 2024-T3 is the finished aluminum tube.

>I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh. I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities. Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize. As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative.

>It's true too. Members went to HARVARD and graduated. But seriously people. I do not like to compair to previous albums but this album and the "Green Album" both capture the magic of the "Blue Album." POWER CHORDS GALORE! Melody, lyrical, harmonization, short and sweet. There isn't more I can say about this album except that you should support good rock and not the commercial B.S. Buy this album.

But I think their old stuff is a little better.

>The lid works well as a substitute for a glass lid and fits perfectly for lodge 10.25" skillet. However, the material is super thin and light-weighted. The lid feels cheap which probably justifies the lower price comparing to other brands. It's definitely not "heavy" or "durable" or "professional-grade" as advertised. The rolled-over edge makes it hard to clean. But my major concern is that there are no stainless steel caps on top of the aluminum rivets, which defeats the purpose of having a stainless steel lid as opposed to an aluminum one that costs less. Aluminum easily reacts to whatever it comes in contact with. In short, if you just want an additional lid without spending much, it's a good price. But I will not buy it again because of my concern about aluminum.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>If it wasn't for the really low price on this I would be very upset with the purchase. It's my first Delta tool and has left me disappointed. It is much louder than the other reviews indicate. Forget talking to anyone while it's on (in a small shop at least). It is also very top heavy and is extremely easy to tip. Hit one expansion joint in the concrete and down she goes.

>I totally disagree with the prior review! The DVD-A format does NOT specify that content be Dolby 5.1. It is simply an extremely high bit rate format, that can be anything from 5.1 channels to simple (very high bit rate) two channel stereo. So, if you love this music, AND have a player that will play DVD-A (not many do), then buy this version immediately. It is a two channel stereo presentation at over 9Mb data rates which means it sounds EXACTLY like the original master tapes. It has all of the analog feel of the original master tapes, with none of the standard CD corruption. A must have if you love this music.

>This one was kind of a bummer for me. I didn't like it as much as I expected to and as The Great Gatsby is my favorite book, I had very high expectations.Out of the nine short stories, I liked one. One. Porcelain and Pink; which appealed to me just because it had a few humorous moments. The other eight stories were either just okay, or a struggle to get through because they just felt so "blah" to me.I really like Fitzgerald, but in my opinion, he is more of a novelist than a short story writer. I haven't disliked any of his novels that I've read (so far), but for some reason, his short stories don't have the same oomph. I was also expecting more of a Jazz theme, rather than a collection of stories that just happen to be set in the 20's when Jazz was the thing.I'm sure there are many people who love his short stories, but were someone to ask me what they should read to start on Fitzgerald's cannon, I would definitely suggest his novels.

>I was loaned this book by somebody presenting it as an "out-there" post modern novel featuring a stream-of-consciousness flow. While it may post-modern, and largely s.o.c (much in the style of a journal), it struck me as much more than a literary experiement. Considering the amount of 3rd person narrative and disjointed "scenes"/short stories/chapters, I found it very engaging, never lacking flow and surprisingly impactful. I can't speak to how much Bulgarian culture came through or how much credit to give the book as an example of non-western thought but there was a freshness that complemented rather than detracted from the ideas laid out in the book - depth in the mundane, coming to grips with pain, and losing one's grip on the order of things (for better or worse)

>I notice how this movie didn't get rated with 5 stars. Maybe because Owen Wilson is always funny with ben stiller by his side. But I gotta say he pulled it off without B.Stiller. Not all can relate to this movie. I know I wish I had someone to fend off the bullies while I was in school. LOL!well, my fav part was when Owen ( Drillbit) told the kids to find a common ground with the bullies. So the fat kid had a free-style (rap) competition with the main bully. Except he only made the bullies more furious and embarassed them.there are other funny parts in the movie but this just made the movie..to me anyway.

>Now that I have your attention, I would like to explain why. Firstly I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it's release and the album is amazing and something everyone should own BUT these early Young releases are in need of remastering especialy if you own a decent sound system. Young has been sitting on his a** way too long to release remasters. Rumour has it he wants a certain sound and an artist has that right but in the meantime clean these up and release them for us living in a digital world. Perhaps if the catalogue slows down pressure will be brought to bear.

>Okay, maybe I'm being picky because I'm on this Jonathan Carroll streak right now and just finished four of his other books before this one. Like his great books, this one has brilliant scenes, concepts and wild plot devices, but I found that it didn't hold together as well as his others. At times, it seems like even Carroll might have lost one of his own threads. This book made me appreciate how great his new one, Marriage of Sticks, is. If you haven't read anything by Carroll before, I'd stick to his others first. If you're a Carroll freak like I am, you'll want to search this one out. Rondua appears in this one too and you may recognize Finky-Linky and some of the usual suspects.

All people have the right to interpret the Bible as they want, as long they do no harm to others.And the religions need to work together. The Muslims taught the Jews and the Christians the philosophy of the Greeks by translating the ancient Greek philosophical works. The period of Enlightenment for Christianity and Judaism, the quest for a rational religion of nature, grew from the writings and teachings of other faiths. Judaism and Christianity contributed to the other and without the other neither would have advanced to the stage they are currently in.

I read another review with the same problem. Good trimmer for 2 summers, moderate use, maybe 6 times all summer. Maintained, stored in a dry place. Third summer it starts but won't stay running. My mechanic friend said all the filters are clean, good fuel, but its only getting the fuel you pre-pump to start it. It would cost about the same to fix what is probably a carburetor problem as buy a new one. Not worth it. And after reading other similar reviews I'm going with something else.

>This was a great toy until it started developing problems. There is something wrong with the on/off so that the battery energy drains unless you use a screwdriver to remove the battery panel then take the batteries out after each use. This is not exactly convenient. Secondly, the "on" doesn't work half the time. Repeated calls to customer service are fruitless (no one answers and no one returns the calls). The pages of the books also rip, and the pen can get stuck in the hinge. In addition, one of the books also was misaligned in printing so that if you point to certain items, it thinks you are indicating something different. (You have to guess where to point the pen.) Believe me, it's alot simpler to pick up a book and teach my child the information in this book than to use this frustrating toy.

>In some respects, I think Yield is a better album, but Binaural still suffices for greatness. Binuaral contains three songs that are not Pearl Jam caliber, though they sound to be at first--God's Dice, Sleight of Hand, and Long Road 2, Parting Ways. Thriteen songs in the album, minus 3, equal 10, all of which are songs that could be played over and over again--some may argue for God's Dice--and I'm not say that it is bad either. The strength of the album is its quirkiness, and the band being able to compose songs that have natural sound to them. I think that's been key to their success. Key words that loom in Binaural are quirkiness,as in Rival and Soon Forget, supressed rage, as heard in Greivance, and mind-playing guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of Vs. but instead retain driving composure as in Of the Girl, Insignificance. What can you say? Vedder and the boys just keeping doing it . . .

>I'm a creature of habit, so I kept buying this specific earpiece for my cell phone, since I liked the way it was designed. Small, simple, and I didn't have to look like someone from "Star Trek" with that dumb thing blinking in my ear. It works well, and has excellent sound quality both for my voice and the earpiece. What I liked is there is this rubber "hook" that keeps it in your ear, and is very comfortable. However, every one I've bought (and I've bought a lot of them) has the same problem which is the "hook" breaks off no matter how gentle you are with it. So then you have to sort of stick the earpiece in your ear, and hope for the best. For a while they were very cheap so it wasn't that bad, but now they are hard to find. Soon they will all be gone, and I'll have to find something else. So should you.

>In 1978, pianist Vladimir Horowitz played his Golden Jubilee concert at Carnegie Hall. I remember buying the original Red Seal vinyl album of this concert. The dynamic range was astounding, at least until I wore the grooves out. The dynamics of this CD, however, don't match what I remember---they seem a bit flat. Still, I was happy to see this recording had been reissued on CD, and in an audiophile 24/96 edition.Everyone was "on" for this concert: Horowitz's performance is outstanding, and the orchestra is superb. Some might quibble that certain parts of this recording were re-recorded to correct mistakes, but I'd rather not here the sour notes, as they tend to ruin my appreciation of the piece.To fill out the CD they added Horowitz's recording of Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2, which is not my favorite piece. Something isn't right; it just doesn't fit either the spirit or the mood generated at the Golden Jubilee concert.

>interspersed with rituals he wrote himself. Most amusing is his lack of command over the German Language - Old or Modern - contrary to his pretensions.The German word 'Gabelreiterinnen' - which Mr Jackson says is a name used by MALE witches in Germany - translates exactly the same now as it would have several centuries ago - "WOMEN Who Ride Forks." Apparently Mr Jackson is unaware that the "in" suffix he applies means that one is speaking about a woman. The correct form for a male would be Der Gabelreiter and the plural could be either Die Gabelreiter or Die Gabelreitern depending on dialekt but Die Gabelreiterin remains a "Woman Riding a Fork" regardless.Like many who cater to the Pagan Federation and the New Age, Mr Jackson's linguistic skills are inconsistent and need double checking.Otherwise, all in all, it's an interesting stitching together of various folk customs and bits of lore.

>More true to form than the original version that starred Gene Wilder, Tim Burton's version gives us scenes that tbey were unable to do before. Such as the squirrils.A much more darker look at Willie Wonka though protrayed well by Johnny Depp, I didn't like it nearly as much. The first one was fun, this one seemed more along the lines of being disturbing. Aside from that minor detail, it was entertaining.In one scene when the Oompa Loompas, who are very disturbingly identical, begin what Willie Wonka calls a 'spontaneous musical number' one of the guests comments that it seems a bit too 'planned' to be spontaneous. Subtle humor like that is what kept me going.The whole time with his dad who was played by Christopher Lee, a giant in the pulp horror of the sixties and seventies, I felt didn't add much to the wonder of the movie. Rather, it gave more of an odd feel to it.Overall, I liked it. NOt as much as the original, but I did like it.

She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true.

>Although I did enjoy this book more than 'Roses Are Red', I am diappointed in the path that Patterson's Alex Cross novels have taken. Each novel in the series since 'Cat and Mouse' has involved less police work and very little suspense. At several points in Violets are Blue, I found myself feeling as though I had read this all before - Cross asking himself questions about the killers, Cross yearning for his current partner, Cross yearning for his former partners from previous books, Cross feeling guilty for not being with his children, etc. Where is the suspense? The police work?? In Violets are Blue, Cross did nothing to catch the vampires or the Mastermind - the police find the vampires on a tip from a journalist, and Cross stumbles across the Mastermind after "having a feeling" - please. I hope Patterson has some better ideas for the next Cross novel.

It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information.

>While others will appreciate samplings from a wide variety of albums, I have to stop and point out that this is called "The very best of..." NOT "A broad overview of...". 'Even in the quitest moments', 'Fool's Overture' are obvious hits that did not make it here, whereas songs such as 'Cannonball', 'Rudy', 'Hide in your shell', and 'Crime of the Century', are just so-so songs and not well-known at all. In fact, when I listen to them I'm not sure if I have even heard them before. 'Crime of the Century' was an album title and so is well-known, but critics considered the album and that song to be a real 'crime'!Of course, this is pretty typical of what the music industry does: intentionally holding big hits off a "best of" album. I have grown used to it, but that doesn't mean I am ever going to approve of it.

I am a fan of all the actors, I wish they had more lines. It didn't hold my children's attention. My daughter (a horse lover) liked it ok. It's a good story and I would love to see them remake it. With the special affects they have now a days it could be really cool.

>Who are the Hutterites? I had no idea. This documentary was responsible for opening my eyes to a completely different world of God-Fearing people. I knew much of the Amish and Mennonites but not the Hutterites. This film explores, with modesty and fairness, this group of men and women living, I believe, in North Dakota. They are simple folks: farming supplies the majority of their livelihood and they are kind to the environment, have an unyielding love of God and are not ashamed to share their beliefs with a world that, otherwise, does not understand their lifestyle. Appreciation for these gentle people will help people of all religions understand the importance of community and worship. I am so glad they still make documentaries like this. This film contains no objectional material, however there is a scene in which ducks are butchered that may disturb younger viewers.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>This book is thorough, however it assumes too much familiarity with the classical repertoire like so many other books on music composition. To utilize this book you would have had to a)perform what seems like nearly all of the classical repertoire when you were in high school and recognize the music by name, b)starting on your masters degree in music or c) be capable of performing all of the examples on sight and want to. This book is not very accessible and is only for experienced classical composers with an emphasis on the 20th centery. Too hoity toity for me. I can't recommend this book to anyone except seasoned classical afficianado's.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Boy was a really good book. I liked it because it never had a boring part. I thought it was cool because it was an autobiography but seemed like a story exept for the fact that he used he, mine, I. The book Boy, was about Roald Dahl's life up until he was a young adult. The main characters in the book would be Roald Dahl who is nicknamed Boy, and his mother. This is a very interesting and descriptive book. I would recommend it to grades 4 through 6, and almost any kind of person.

>This 2,000-year- old self-help book is as relevant today as when Epictetus (slave turned philosopher) wrote it. The Enchiridion is a simple and pragmatic guide to Stoic conduct.When someone speaks ill of you, rather than defend yourself (thereby giving legitimacy to the insult), reply, "...The man did not know the rest of my faults, for he would not have mentioned these only."This is a book about conduct, dignity, and moderation. "Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the things..."When dealing with people who need to inflate themselves at the expense of others: "I am richer than you, therefore I am better than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you...But you are neither possessions nor speech."This is a very short read, but worth rereading from time-to-time.

>Let's see....where can I begin?This book allows the strange continuance of events in the first book of the series.In this book Hawaii is successfully invaded by Japan. I ask how? With the aircraft carrier Hillary Clinton in permanent dock in the continental US it's entire compliment of aircraft would reasonably have been based in Hawaii....including it's AWAC's. How could an invasion fleet (even a rogue 2020 ship) get close enough for a strike/invasion?I applaud Birmingham's idea behind the book series when it comes to social effects, but the difference in military abilities over the 80 years in the span are simply so great that there is no way a 1940's naval force could succeed. It renders the basic premise untenable.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>the words, melodies, arrangements, all have been changed. The first track is a traditional choral arrangement but after that it goes down hill quickly. Other than the always magnificent sound of the full choir and organ this album is a disappointment.Really, if you are looking for traditional sounding Christmas music this totally misses the mark. I've been involved in choral music for more than 30 years and I've never heard so many questionable arrangements in one album. Echoing another review, if you want to edit Christ out of Christmas the title should read "The Mormon Tabernacles Tribute to the Traditional Winter Solstice Holiday". The Brooklyn Tabernacle Christmas albums are always not traditional Christmas music but they will lift high your spirit with their souring sound.If you really want this album, look on eBay I'll be selling my copy for $1-2.

>I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.As all the men on the detective squad are so "shocked" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.

>I'll keep it short: this is not Loeb & Sale at their best.. I'm a fan of all their work from the Marvel color theme (Spider-Man: Blue, Hulk: Grey, Daredevil: Yellow, and that one issue of Capt. America: White), and I enjoyed both Batman: Long Halloween & Batman: Dark Victory... Even their work on the TV show Heroes was great...Haunted Knight is shallow at best. There's one scene where Gordon invites Batman to Bruce Wayne's costume party. "You could come as you are," I believe is how Jim sells it... Very shallow, lacking a real grasp of any characters, relying instead on prejudices based on superficial observations.The artwork is great, though if you like Tim Sale. His work is worth the paperback price. My daughter and I plan on whiting out the text/word bubbles, and writing a more fitting story.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>This CD is a huge disappointment. Clay has such an awesome voice, and this CD does little to show off his true talent. The songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off Clay's gift. I've read many reviews of this CD and the most recent stated the same. It lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old CD's. Good luck next time Clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>This anime is the second of D's adventures. The animation is much better than in the first one. I would say that this story is mixture between "BLADE' and "Bram Stokers Dracula".Now for the DVD itself. The sound is pretty good except that the music is pretty loud compared to the lyrics. The features are all pretty interesting. The only and biggest problem is:THERE IS NO ORIGINAL AUDIO TRACK IN JAPANESE which is unforgivable. Even if the english dubbing is not bad it is still no match for the japanese version!

>Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>I bought Gravity eagerly when it came out. I was a little worried about Bob Rock being the producer (this being the same guy that ruined Metallica), but I kept an open mind about it. In the end, I've come to the conclusion that this album is a serious let-down. It feels rushed and shallow. I liked the general feel of "Happiness..." and the concept of "Spiritual Machines". This album, however, just feels like it was made for the radio, and I HATE mainstream radio. There are a couple of good songs on the album (All For You, Not Enough, Somewhere out There), but the rest is just too cliched.While it is a good album on its own merits (on the sheer talent of the band), it just seems like the band was going for mainstream US success more than making great music.Well, at least I wont get as many blank stares when people look through my CDs.

>this book was a delight to read, even as an adult reader. The retelling of the ark story in this colourful, jocular and modern manner was just enchanting and my 5 year old enjoyed it immensely.

>I ordered this shoe after reading some good reviews on Amazon. I spend all day on my feet at work and so I wanted a comfortable shoe and this certainly is that. My only negative is that the tongue of the shoe is well made but is a bit stiff, so the break in period had to be supplemented with some padding to ameliorate some soreness where the shoe tongue was making contact with my upper ankle. Other than that I am happy with the shoe.

>I bought this book a long time ago and have read it several times since. I absolutely love this book because it doesn't romanticize the conflicts between Native Americans and the white settlers. Molly was able to get past what the Native Americans had done to her family and accept her new life, even after she had an opportunity to go back to the white settlers. She began to see the Seneca as her new family. Molly is a model character because she is not only brave, but also forgiving despite all of the horrible things she was put through.

>I think that seventh generation diapers are as good as anything else that's out there as far as absorbancy, fit, etc., but better because they do not have that awful chemical smell and they are better for the environment. I agree with the others that have reviewed this product that said that they like the old ones better. I do think these ones fit a little better, but like they said, they leave a gel residue, which I really don't like. I hope that seventh generation switches back to whatever they used to use that didn't leave the residue. I thought that those diapers worked just fine.

A little too small for an overnight, it is great for day trips for carrying water, laptop etc, and looks pretty good on the bike, even when empty. I haven't tested it in bad weather yet, but it looks like it will keep things dry for a while (unless you are in a hurricane). I rated it 4 because it was made in the PRC, and not in the USA, (which it is priced for) - I wish manufacturers would clearly state where their products are made in their advertising, so that when you buy an "American" product from a US brand, you get something made in the USA. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the quality of the PRC produced product - I just wish I knew that before pressing the "buy now" button.

Ballads like Heart (Don't Change My Mind) and When You Tell Me That You Love Me sound like typical album tracks, and the same can be said for the pop-dance numbers such as Change Of Heart and the title track, although the latter does have some nice guitar work. One track grips you and that is Battlefield, but one swallow does not make a season. Diana in blandland.

In order for it to work it has to be so tight on her throat that the prongs are jabbed into her neck, so I would NEVER recommend leaving your dog unsupervised with it on! It also must be exactly in the right spot on her throat - which I have yet to figure out where the magic spot is. I would not buy this collar again - way too unreliable!

Davis and others, to coverthe the reformulations in sociobiology performed by Galton, and its influence in the British Empire and other countries. These are very alive in the billion victims in the Third World.This encyclopedia ignore the genocide in India with 30 billion victims explained in the Davies book.

>La novela es genial, inmortal, imperecedera. Pero esta versión que vende Amazon es un versión recortada e incompleta, casi la mitad de la novela que autorizó Tolstoi. No sé si es la misma versión que edita en papel la editorial Juventud que es la mitad de la novela completa. Fue un chasco para mí descubrirlo, pues ya la tenía en papel en la edición de Planeta con la traducción de Alcántara y Laín Entralgo e introducción de Eduardo Mendoza y al compararlas me di cuenta. Espero que Amazon ponga a la venta esta novela en la versión completa, preferiblemente en la traducción de Lydia Kuper. Pr eso mi valoración es por esta versión en concreto no a la novela en sí.

>A globial adventure in extreme cuisines...INDEED! Asking the question, "What would be the perfect meal?" Bourdain "Kitchen Confidential," newest book, "A Cooks Tour," is a joke at best. Going from one EXTREME to another made little or no sense at all to me. From Asia to Europe, Africa, and, parts of the U.S.A and god forbide I forget to mention Harry Kissinger and Bourdain's comparison of Cambodia to Vietnam all in the name of CULINARY JOURNALISM ! HELLO, Mr. Doofis, I thought I was going to get a few interesting ideas on "WHAT THE PERFECT MEAL WOULD BE," not an adventure in "AS YOUR STOMACH TURNS !"

>He has interesting points to consider but Chamber's theology often differs from mine. So, for me, I won't purchase another one of his books. You'll have to decide for yourself. It also was a little "choppy"...I believe you could find a more cohesive book on the subject.

>I loved the first 2 Jaws films. As a child I saw this one also and it scared me, I was in the video saw and decided to rent it.

>I have never read the book, and all I know of the story is what I saw in this movie. I don't think the story was developed very well. There was little dialogue and little to show that Anna was interested in Vronsky until all of sudden she's crazy about him. It's surprising also when she says his love for her has faded and thinks he is going to marry someone else -- We hadn't really seen anything to lead us to that conclusion. So the end is especially tragic because watching this movie you can't even tell if she was right in her suspicions. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the picture and audio was poor.

>I returned this product the same day I got it. While it is relatively inexpensive, you can get (for the same price) a Plano case at meijer that is 3x stronger than this one. All I wanted this case for was transporting my Rem. 870 to and from the range. While it technically could achieve this purpose, I felt as though the case would break on the way. The plastic is very flimsy. The padding is ok (good enough), but like I said, Plano makes other cases for the same price that are much stronger.

>I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day.

>The late 90's was not a golden period for rock music. It was a time when critics & fans contorted themselves into agonising positions where mediocre neu-psychedelic bands like Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips started to sound good.Hopefully the arrival of some inspired new bands in 2001 - the Strokes, the White Stripes - will pound the nails into the coffin of this dreary genre.Now and again on this CD you recognise the playing of the wonderful Garth Hudson, and the memory of all the brilliant old Band albums he played on utterly overwhelms his current surroundings. And that second-hand pleasure is about all this music offered me.

>As musicians, Bond really stands out, even on this DVD, but as show-women, they need a lot of work. Haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog. And as a group, they didn't do much in the way of actual "entertaining". They simpy played their music. It may possible that it was planned that way....consider the British audience....but if that was the case, they should have recorded some other performance for release on DVD. In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it.

>Wow. I've never seen so much "borrowing" done. It's amazing!In my opinion, this should not be allowed to happen, but evidently I must be in the minority. Perhaps most people are not so well read as I and think that this book is in some way original. In my opinion, it is in no way original. There are borrowings from every major work of fantasy and most minor ones. It's really distracting as you attempt to read. This is one of the few books that I have started and could just not continue with. It was truely horrid. Wonderful beginners work, I guess and great for a seventeen year old, but why publish it?

Predicted: POSITIVE

>A great book, an unreserved 4 stars.On the "difficult read" point many reviewers keep in raising. I've always held the opinion that when writing use the simplest and clearest language of conveying your ideas - so do not use uncommonly used or difficult world when they can be avoided. I've always associated an author who uses difficult words as an intellectual snob.In this regard the 2nd Chronicle is a lot worse that the 1st, it seems like Donaldson has swallowed a thesaurus.Just for the amusement of all here are a few Donaldson classics:Why use "Celerity" when you could use "Speed".Why use "Mien" when you could use "Expression".Why use "Filigree" when you could use "Delicate Pattern"And...Why the use "Tintinnabulation" when you could use "ringing of bells"!?!

>This book is a very low-level introduction to jodo, primarily Shindo Muso Ryu jo. It definitely won't provide good enough instruction to learn any of the basic techniques or kata, and it isn't very comprehensive, only useful for the extreme beginner while they're still in the beginner stages. The book also only covers the forms chosen for the Seitei Jodo set, ignoring the traditional form sets. A much better book would be the book "Jodo: the Way of the Stick" (aka La voie du baton, I think, the book is split into both English and French sections), which provides a much more comprehensive set of explanations, techniques (covers omote, chuden, and ranai: the Seitei forms are miscellaneous kata chosen from these sets), and background on SMR jodo and budo in general.

>This hard drive enclosure works just fine, but it comes with a couple of ridiculous screws that are so unbelievably tiny that there is no way that I could possibly get a grip on them to put them in. The screws are meant to screw the hard drive in place to the enclosure so that the hard drive doesn't move around inside the enclosure.I have never in my life seen screws this small. They're like the size of an eyelash. And if you drop one you can forget about finding it ever again.Since these screws are impossible to use, you will just have to use the hard drive inside the enclosure without screwing it in and securing it.Other than that, the enlosure works OK. You do need two USB ports to plug it in though, not one, in order to provide enough power to the drive.

>The book fear and loathing in las vegas, by the brilliant Hunter S. Thompson, was a fantastic book filled with social issues like the death of the american dream. The movie, however, had all of the high points of the book taken out and was turned into a crappy stoner flick. The high point of this film, is an astonishingly good preformance by Johnny Depp as deranged sports writer Hunter Thompson, aka Raoul Duke. Buy the book not the movie.

>Season two was definitely the best season, don't get me wrong, but one of the things that made Dawson's Creek such an amazing show was it's music, and this DVD ruins that aspect of the show. I regret buying this DVD. I feel misled and wronged. The episodes are still great, so if you have never seen them before I'd still recommend getting them to see a great show, but as someone who saw it with the original music (and as someone who bought the DC soundtracks) I can't help but cringe when I hear what they have done to the music. It really does ruin it the whole thing. I will be sure to research future seasons when they come out and I will never buy another season that has been "remixed."

>The stroller does beat the average $20 stroller because it does unzipper and lays back a bit. It has a small basket underneath but it's better than nothing. As far as the canopy, it drives my crazy cause it slides off and there's no way to keep it from doing that when you put it back behind the baby, even when you try to bend the front of the canopy. It does fold easy and is compact. But I don't think i would really recommend this stroller to anyone.

>I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.

>I love Duran Duran and was so excited to get this video. This video is just for serious fans only. I did not know what to expect with this video. I had hoped a few interviews from the band or some minor video clips. The entire hour is music critics and Paul Berrows discussing the music and impact of D2, hence the title the Ultimate review. Small clips of music, but nothing really to note. It is a must for Duran fans only.

Up to now, I have not found any reference to this irritating procedure in the Nikon manuals, specifications, or camera sale's blurbs.

>I've had mine for years, I bought it from Amazon circa 2003. Recently it gave me a 'thin blue line' on the left side after it acquired satellites. If yours does it, please update the on board software to version 3.90 or later. Software is available for download for free at garmin's website.The problem stems from a new WAAS satellite launched in early 2008. The software patch fixes that. If you do not have WAAS turned, you will not see a problem, just your accuracy wont be as good as you would like it to be. I found the new update actually made the time to acquire a lot faster and its more sensitive now and picks up signals easier.I love my Etrex Legend. From all the hiking I've done its never let me down until last weekend. So update your etrex and enjoy the outdoors.

We have four boys and the older crib is made more durable. This will last for a couple of months just long enough to let our 22 month get used to a toddler bed and we can go back to using the older crib. Spend the extra money and get a better bed so it will last through other children!!!

>This book gives astrology's critics all the ammunition they need. Simplistic, silly and stereotypical profiles, with no acknowledging the complexity of character and personality. Also, I know the book was written in the 60's but the incredible sexism kept my teeth on edge.

>I read the book because it was listed as a great classic in English Literature. If this is a great classic, I am on the wrong planet.

>I read many novels, many of them classics in under a week. This one took me a MONTH! I found the beginning to be extremely slow, but the book did pick up in the end. I can't really decide whether or not I liked Fanny, but she did need a little self-confidence. Edmund seemed a little too good to be true, and Aunt Norris was a total witch. I had a hard time believing the character relationships in this book as they seemed impossible because the people were HORRIBLE to eachother. Also, Uncle Bertram seemed to have a complete reformation that was a little unbelievable. I dragged through this book until it picked up at the end. I was sad to see it end, and I think Austen could have devoted more than 2 pages to Fanny and Edmund's romance at the end because it took so long to happen, though who am I to be a critic, I could never write anything close to Jane Austen! Read this book for the ending, but don't expect it be a fast read!

>During her travels through Yugoslavia Rebecca West was mostly accompanied by Constantine, a Serbian Government Official, most of her explanation of historical events are actualy the opionion of her travel companion. Constantine is a strong supporter of a Yugoslavia, therefore he is not only Pro-Serbian but is racist against Croats and Muslims. It is very evident in this book that Ms. West has developed this racist attitude as well.I found the book very difficult to follow because of her poetic descriptions of situations and her habit of wandering off on tangents. I recommend the book, solely as a good travel book and not as a good source of history. I recommend instead, A Nation Forged in War by Marcus Tanner as a history book, not only is Marcus Tanner's book well written and organized, it is very objective, therefore reader gets a better understanding of why certain ethnic groups would feel a certain way.

>Tim Riley's book on Dylan starts fresh. He provides one of the best appreciations of Dylan's voice I have read. OK so the guy has a fresh point of view. Then he weighs into Dylan's early work with gusto. Riley appreciates Dylan's socio political protest in the image of Woodie Gutherie and also gets into what he imagines is drug fueled creativity up to 1966. He finds a drug behind every bush though which is possible but misses the multiple layering of Dylan's work. Then like the folkies who dis Dylan at Newport he starts to turn sour on Dylan during the post-66 period and gets nastier as the book moves on. Until finally in the Epilogue Riley becomes the master of mean invective against Dylan and everyone, except Wilco? Oh yeah, they are singing Woodie Gutherie songs to new tunes - right. There's the connection.My advice - borrow the book, read until Blood on the Tracks and quit. The rest will spoil your day.

The person I read about is a stranger to me though I was wife #1(there's a #2 as well) from 1950 thru 1974(a marriage that produced 3 children). I will grant that he was a brilliant & imaginative man, though perhaps a bit psychotic. I caution to beware.

This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something "deeper" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you.

>This is the most positive and helpful material I have found for working with dyslexic children. I tried the techniques Ron Davis outlines this year with an 8 year-old girl diagnosed with dyslexia. She progressed from a Reading Recovery testing level of 6 (PP2) in October to a level of 24 (3.2) in May. We will continue the words/definitions in clay this summer. I was amazed that she understood what I was asking her to do. I'm not sure I understand it because my mind doesn't work that way. I tried just using Reading Recovery techniques but it wasn't enough. She seemed to need to discovery and control her mind's eye. Her body is so much more relaxed and she doesn't rub her feet on the carpet when she can contol her mind's eye. This book offers a way to help children rather than label them.

What would happen to Jane next? Questions would race through my head and so I wouldanswer them myself by continuing to read. I finished it the next night. Ms. Pimentel was right. Every girl SHOULD read Jane Eyre.

>My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead.

>This coffee machine does a nice job of brewing coffee quickly and delivering a good taste. However, it is overpriced, and no matter how careful you are about positioning the carafe, you are going to having coffee, coffee, everywhere! I've had the machine less than two years, and I've replaced almost every part and still coffee often flows all over my counter. The frustrating thing is, I can't figure out why it flows all over the place sometimes and not on other times. So forget about using the automatic timer! The pause feature also didn't work after about six months. You pull the carafe out and, more coffee on your counter. As soon as I finish the last box of charcoal filters I bought for it, I'm throwing the machine away.

>Imagine that. A movie that doesn't use shock tactics, grossness, bodily function references and the seven bad words you used to not be able to say on television to be funny.

>Geez. I generally like - at least - one track on each Alice solo album. But, my God!, this one has no redeeming qualities whatsoever - zip, zilch. I have to admit that it is a unique album, but only in the same way Ed Wood makes "unique" movies. Upon listening to it, one must wonder what was going on in Alice's mind -- was his mind on how well he would play in his next golf match? It certainly wasn't on the music. If you're in any way masochistic, get this CD now and play it "'til your eardrums bleed..."! Or, perhaps, there's that special enemy that deserves a little revenge? That works, as well. In 1973 on the album "Billion Dollar Babies", Alice sang of "Sick Things" -- he may have foreseen this album's release ten years later.

>When you are in the store and you see this software... IGNORE IT! It is so limited. The box says you can draw a 3D object, but that object turns out to be a wall about one inch thick. Also, it does not allow you to layer the things you draw. The only semi-cool thing you can do is create a mickey mouse that has no eyes or fingers. This product is really for kids at the age of six or below. So if you go out thinking that you are getting a good deal for 3D animation/drawing tools, you are way off. All in all, on a scale from one to five, I give it a negative five, but that was not a choice in the ratings so I had to pick one. So in conclusion, IT STINKS LIKE ROTTON EGGS!

>I've seen this method in action and it seems to work, so no issues there. The book is very repetitive. But it didn't take long as it was an easy read. He could probably cut out half the pages if he didn't review what he already said over and over again. The DVD is much more to the point and the visual is good, which is why I rented it from the library for my hubby to watch. It was much easier to watch the 40 minute DVD than to get my hubby to read through the book. Same message. The book only gives a little more background information on debunking the "causes" of colic - going through each one and discussing, where in the DVD he gets straight to his methods. While I like the book, I think it would have been better to take out of the library and return. Once you know the info, there's no reason to refer back to it.

>I saw someone mention this book on a documentary I watched and decided it looked kind of interesting. I will have to say I've enjoyed reading it, but the book was more about Janice Knowlton (The author) and her childhood than Beth Short. Don't get me wrong, the book is very entertaining and interesting but I highly doubt anything in this book happened. If you're looking for FACTS about the Black Dahliah case then this isn't the book for you. If anything in this book is true, I would be shocked. But if you're just curious about what Janice Knowlton has to say about this case, then this is a great book for you! I'm convinced Jan Knowlton was a very troubled woman and none of this is true.

When RJ (or whoever) actually does advance any story line he does it in less than a paragraph, or, as a teaser. I truly enjoy this series, and if it never concluded that would be fine with me, but lets have a story. Before you buy this one, re-read the other nine, then re-read them again.

>Most books on controversial subject matter embody a certain element of overkill to prove their point but Michael Rose is 'shockingly on the mark' with, Good Bye! Good Men. Many in Detroit have lived through what Mr Rose describes in his book. A close friend was subjected to professional psychological counseling for a year (at his own expense) and needed none. The final report read, This client did not need counseling and has no sign of pathology or abnormality. Basically, he was just too Catholic. The current sexual crisis in Holy Mother Church clearly shows what the Liberalism of 1960-1985 produced. This brand of mis-guided and unholy leadership never results in reform or progress. Through the concerted efforts of current Rector, Bishop Allen Vigneron, Sacred Heart Seminary is healing from what I call "Metastatic Liberalism" and today continues to heal and grow in Grace and in Favor with God and Man.

>This is a book that suffers from the journalist's predicament, flat emotions in emotional situations. There seem to be a couple of reasons why that is so. One of them is the question, what is Barbara Kingsolver attempting to do in this novel? Is she telling a missionary story? Is she telling the story of the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of the newly independent Congo? Or what? It is hard to answer this question. Secondly, her method seemed appealing at first, telling the story of a family unprepared for mission work yet driven by an unsympathetic father, Nathan Price, to the Congo in 1959 when the Congo is being exploited by Belgium, telling that story from the perspective of his four daughters. Each of them has her own peculiar take on their situation; yet each increasing comes to seem disembodied, floating above the people and emotions and reality of their own lives.

>I was very disappointed with this novel; my first foray into Heinlein. Heinlein's prose in Citizen of the Galaxy is atrocious. Massive uses of semicolons; just like I am doing in this review. Very annoying; I had to stop on page 55; also lots and lots of cliches; and the dialogue is sophomoric and clumsy, for someone used to reading Malamud and Updike. (For comparison purposes, though:Asimov's fiction prose: I like; Alan Edward Nourse's fiction prose for both juveniles and adults: I love)I am currently reading and immensely enjoying Grumbles from the Grave; so I know that Heinlein can write well.I will now try my hand at Starship Troopers; which according to Grumbles, Heinlein considered an adult novel in the guise of a juvenile fiction.

>A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he "took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done". It nearly sent me to sleep.

Like the all other reviwers said, it is a pain to clean but it is worth it!BE AWARE: The narrow neck Dr. brown bottle could still cause gas problem because the nipple is so small that a baby can suck in some air while feeding.

>ALIENS is one of those truly rare animals: a sequel more than worthy of its successor. Where ALIEN is an endless anxiety attack, ALIENS is a bungie jump from the Tower of Babel. Controversial call, however: such a pity the original cinematic release doesn't receive the respect it deserves for being the better of the two available versions. The extra 17 minutes in the Special Edition/Director's Cut version was largely unnecessary (which is why it was removed in the first place). Perhaps with the exception of the 'sentry guns' scenes, those 17 minutes serve only to reduce the build in tension that is so effective in the cinematic release. Will Fox make the original version available on DVD? We can only hope.

>This cane arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.The pros: comfortable, seemingly durable foam handle; it's easy to adjust for different heights; nice color and finish.The con (and it's a big one): it's slightly wobbly. If you place it flat on the ground and apply slight pressure to the handle, it wobbles as though one foot is slightly shorter than the other three. Upon closer examination, that was exactly the case! I went to a local drugstore to look at others. Maybe is was suppose to be that way, I thought. However, the quad canes I found at RiteAid were much more stable. Their legs were all of even length. I read a similar complaint about this a Duro-Med cane so I can't help but wonder if this company is trying to unload the canes that weren't manufactured properly.

>There are many cultural problems with this story, but set those aside. This is one of Menken's triumphs..nearly seamless music from one end to the other, all inventive and inventively scored.

I suppose that regardless of the quality of the poetry, it is still important to read because Eliot himself is important in the canon. But I have to wonder. It gets rather sing songy at times and there doesn't seem to be much technical mastery to the poem. And I hated the subject matter.

>I've always been a fan of Disney's Hercules, so the Gold Collection video is a treat! At the end there is a "making-of" documentary that shows everything about the movie's production process--including interviews with the voice actors and directors. I only wish it were longer! But still, it's a pretty good overview. What the video DOESN'T advertise on the jacket is a special Ricky Martin music video shown after the documentary (which I don't understand why--it seems he would be a big selling point for the video). Ricky sings the Spanish version of "Go the Distance" entitled "No Importa La Distancia." In case you didn't know, Ricky was the voice of Hercules for the Spanish language version. So if you're a Hercules fan, or a Ricky Martin fan, grab this video!

>Well, if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more, you may fear you missed an Andy Bell gem. This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it. Ashame they couldn't have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi-single release of Crazy.

>The Exorcist is no longer scary, disturbing or suspenseful. Tubular Bells is played for all of maybe 45 seconds the whole movie. The language is mild compared to even yesterday's pro wrestling, but the hokey gore etc. during the once horrifying demonic possession scenes are still there. The spider walk scene lasts maybe 10 seconds. The whole movie is maybe two hours long. Yes, it is Christian propaganda but it has appeared to have mellowed with age. This is abolutely nothing compared to even Night of the Demons 2, the last movie that genuinely unnerved me. As a Christian drama about demonic possession it's nearly a masterpiece, but like my pastor said, you can take a 76 Chevy, paint it, and it'll still be a 76 Chevy. Meaning here- what was scary as hell in the 70s hardly raises and eyebrow today even with a measly 11 minutes of added footage. Oh, and the prequel Dominion was bad. But still I liked it as a Christian drama. The horror isn't there any more.

Took a little tweeking to get the two pieces aligned but went relatively smooth. Second issue, the packaging for transit sucks. Inside the box they designed the padding poorly (expanded styrofoam). One end had a large block of foam surrounding it the other had little padding at all and in turn one of the plastic foot pads was broken. I was able to make the repair in short order but this should never have happened. A full block of foam padding at both ends would have prevented this.

>It's funny. I got into them before everybody else did. I purchased this CD before everyone else did. They were even my favorite band at one point until they became overplayed on the radio and MTV and became everyone else's favorite band.What's also funny is that I think most of the people on here that gave it a 1-star review, do that only because Linkin Park is popular, but forget to realize this that this album was created before fame. However, a 1-star for their latest release, Meteora, is justifiable, seeing how they tried to recreate Hybrid Theory.But still, I have to rate Hybrid Theory on how much I enjoy the album, thus the 5 stars. Very enjoyable. Pretty good musicianship, creativity, and at least SOME originality. Too bad that all went away on Meteora. Sometimes I wish Linkin Park never got really popular, because than they would still be good.

>I won't deny it: I enjoyed the Matrix. It's a fun film. It's got great special effects, quick pacing, and a compelling story-line. In the end, though, it's nothing more than a fast-paced action flick with high production values but no substance or meaning, wooden acting, and a lack of original ideas. The story is stylish but cliched: A dystopian future run by machines, the search for a prophecided messiah, a ragged band of rebels fighting against the system, reality as a work of fiction, the choice between an idyllic life in slavery or a tortuous life in freedom--we've seen all of these before, just never with so many guns and black coats.The special effects are great, the action is quick-paced, and the story is fun to follow, but that's about as deep as this movie gets. It is an expensive, mindless blockbuster, hardly the beginning of a brilliant, inspired mythology for the new millenium.

>The Office pattern has become stereotyped lately. Every once in a while there's a good episode: where the characters are believable, the observations interesting, the humor subtle.Most of the rest of the time, the humor just becomes, well, TV-sitcom is all I can think of as how to describe it. Overwritten, strained situations in which slapstick and silliness, not deftness, play the main roles.This was a good example of a bad episode, with puerile, inappropriate slapstick. Once more, Dwight has become silly rather than interesting, (he was taken seriously for a while in seasons 2 and 3).I suspect there's some kind of battle for artistic direction in the series, one which is being most lost but hasn't been completely. E.g the previous episode was quite good.

Rather than focusing on the deaths of the characters, (if you seen a slasher movie, you know what I mean) this film focusses on getting to know and care for the characters before they're torn up by werewolves. But don't let that fool you. This movie contains some awesome action sequences. Rent and or buy this. It's worth it. ARRRROOOOOOWWWW!

If you think that the world we live in is bad you should read The Giver, cause they dont have all the things we have it has no color nothing you dont even get to have a opinion. If you read this book you will have a differnt perspective of our community. But one thing I didn't like about the book was the ending it should of told more at what happened to Jonas and Gabe.

>You want a good tone-poem, buy a recording of Smetana's "Ma Vlast" - Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic do a great job on this piece. But this piece is really quite...well, lame. The whole piece (with the possible exception of the choral finale), sounds as though it is trying to line up with a bad version of "Braveheart." McCartney, although an amazingly good performer and one of the century's best songwriters, simply cannot hold his own in the Classical field. As Stravinsky once put it, classical music "is a different fraternity." And it is one in which McCartney does not cut it. If you like cliched movie music, then by all means buy this album, and you will like it. But I just do not feel that this piece has any meat that listeners can sink their teeth into.

Certainly works well...you can hear the cat "slurping" from the bottle rooms away. Cat is placed on metal rod on heavy, battery-operated basket, magnetic bottle is placed to cat's pie-hole, and the result...well, let's just say that I am reminded of the guy that Rizzo takes to the school dance instead of Kenickie in the movie "Grease".

>One of the songs on the new Ryan Adams CD is called "Easy Plateau." It's an especially poignant title in that it's a polite way of summing up the feel of the whole darn album. Filled with mid-tempo drivel and buffed to a high production sheen, there's absolutely nothing here to grab onto - no pathos, no ebb-and-flow, no peaks and valleys. It's like someone sucked all the spooky ethos out of Chris Isaac and shoved a lap steel player into the studio with him.This is the genius behind Whiskeytown?

>I am afraid that Night Shyamalan is one of those one-hit wonders. The Sixth Sense was fantastic, but every movie since then has been a wash. This one, like all his recent endeavors, had a good basic premise, but under the weight of bad writing, bad directing, and a totally self-contradictory plot (how can the "bad guy" be criminally "insane" if the "good guy" actually IS a super hero?) it sank like a stone. The acting was stiff and unconvincing. Spencer Treat Clark had clearly been told to "hesitate" and, with the reliability of a robot, he did so on every sentence. Robin Wright Penn looked justifiably pained throughout the ordeal. And Bruce Willis was only slightly less paralyzed than Samuel L. Jackson. The fact that all of these actors can act quite well but didn't in this film, needs to be laid at the door of the director. Night, for your next film, consider outsourcing.

>After reading reviews on the book, I went out and bought it. I was able to put the book down, in fact, I was able to to it three times. While I am sure many will get take away some useful tidbit, overall, I found the book lightweight in its seven decisions - no real life changing motivation. The one part I did enjoy was learning the story of the Civil War hero, if only from the historical point of view.I found myself comparing the book to Og Mandino's book, The Greatest Miracle In The World" which I found to be a wonderful read. The Traveler's Gift style resembles what Og Mandino often did in his books - tell a story and incorporate life lessons. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.A nice book but not worthy of all the hype it has been receiving.

Subsequently, I transcribed the recordings and edited the resulting manuscript. Winning the Money Game (WTMG) is the result. I now make my living as an author-editor and needed a copy of WTMG to send to a prospective client for whom I propose to perform the same service since he recently produced a multi-speaker conference. Since its publication, WTMG has sold tens-of-thousands of copies and was reprinted by a division of Prentice Hall in the early 80s. For obvious reasons, I highly recommend this book. Don Dible

>I gave this book two stars because I am not big on reading books that include every detail of every second. I realie that when writing fiction books you must show a lot of detail to make the reader feel as though it is a real place or time but, when the main characters breakfast is describe to a "T", that is getting a little dicouraging. Ann Petry did write a good book, better than I could of wrote and I would recommend reading it to others but, I would never read it again. The ending left a little to be desired as well. When a book makes it hard for you to stay interested and then kind of leaves you hanging at the end it makes it hard to give it a good review.

>Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Douglas Quaid, an otherwise ordinary man who discovers that his memories and his life are false, and the truth to his real identity is on planet Mars. The second of Paul Verhoeven's big-budget sci-fi actioners (The other films being Robocop, Starship Troopers, and Hollow Man), it's also his weakest. After a good beginning, everything goes downhill with repetitive action scenes that don't generate many thrills, and quite frankly, Schwarzenegger is just wrong for the role. Verhoeven's a fine action director, but his talent isn't showcased particularly well here. The final plot twist is a good shocker, however.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>The Director's cut is the BEST version. The extra 17 minutes some people complaining about are essential, not only to understand Ripley's relation with Newt, but also to the complete saga, the development of Ripley's psyche. I think these scenes never should have been deleted in the first place, cause they make the characters more human and sympathetic.

>Although I enjoyed listening to Notorious KIM and Hardcore for a while, I don't really enjoy listening to this one. Her songs on this album don't reflect any originality nor any new recently-covered ground. The subject matter is much the same as in her previous album. And also, I'm so sick of listening to Lil'Kim bash Foxy Brown in her songs!! She needs to get over the fact that Foxy Brown is better and to just admit it. In conclusion, if you currently don't own any Lil Kim albums, you might as well just buy her debut "Hardcore" album because it represents Lil Kim when she first started out and it shows what little spec of creativity she might have had...even then.

>The love of Christ in my husband is what saved my marriage. My husband waited patiently for me to stop cheating, showed his love and devotion daily, and forgave before I asked for forgiveness. There was nothing tough about his unconditional love for me. We are more in love than ever before and cherish each other. He extended love to me I didn't deserve when I didn't deserve it...when I was deep in sin. Isn't that the picture of Christ's love for us? That very act of love on his part won my soul over to God.Understanding the Bible and God's nature is a good way to start on fixing your relationship and knowing boundaries.If you want a good book with good advice, read your Bible. If not, contact No Greater Joy Ministries and they have biblical books listing scripture after scripture. May God bless all you struggling in your marriage and give you unconditional love and strength to endure. The power of His love is amazing.

>A truly great love story should be about real people with real faults and real warts. Sparks writes his story about handsome Noah who reads poetry, works incredibly hard, communes with natures, and loves intensely and steadfastly. Allie is incredibly beautiful and soulful (or so we are told, although we are shown no evidence of it) and a tremedously talented artist. The first half of the book is told with all the depth of a fairy tale. What isn't fairy tale is cliche. There's even a scene where they are caught in the rain and he can't help but notice her erect nipples protruding against her wet dress. The second half becomes slighter better, but is marred by the same lack of reality. Allie is still perfect, even in her old age and disease. Her memory is her only deficit. There is no real substance here, just lovely fluffy cotton candy.

>CDNow offers previews for a reason, so people can her the stuff before they buy a CD. If people were smart enough to preview this stuff they would know the amount of screaming and emotion in the songs. Instead they buy it and complain about the money that they just wasted. This CD is Amazing, pure and simple. If it screaming you like buy it. The lyrics will rip you apart. I saw these guys down at warped tour and holy crap some of the best stuff, there is so much energy. Usually I'm not much of a fan for a lot of screaming. But the guitar work alone makes up for it. The guitar is just mind blowing to me, I love how technical it gets. But I warn you, if you don't like more screaming then singing don't buy it. This isn't always for everyone, especially people who don't like to keep open minds about music. Screaming isn't all that bad. I find it even more emotional than screaming, if you ever catch some of these lyrics you will understand. Definitely check them out though.

>I've meant to read this for years. (Love Tolkien, Asimov's Foundation, and Harry Potter.)It is a painfully slow, grim story of two-dimensional characters and nature descriptions that reads more like the account of a self-flagellant religious than a story of discovery and adventure.Tolkein was right to distrust allegory in all of its forms.Rob Inglis got me through a book I would never have finished in print, but he also may have been the wrong reader for this story.

>I was really looking forward to this book. The subject, the repercussions till today ... I have lived a very long time in this geographical area and have therefore a deep interest.Rushdie's book reminded me of so many visits of locals where at the end you were asking yourself, what was the purpose and what were we talking about? These instances and the book have one thing in common: a complete waste of time. And Indians, as well as Nepalis, are very good at that.In Midnight's Children it seems that SR's ego - and boy, so called Indian intellectuals do sport quite some ego - simply went haywire. The book is an exercise in overtwisting a twist, in being oh so very clever or as the Germans say it approaches the subject 'from the back through the chest and into the eye'.

>This book is clearly the definitive book on the subject. Extensively researched this book covers every aspect of enforced sex from the literature (going back to Greek times), from history as in the rape of Nanking and the Russian use of rape in Berlin almost as a matter of policy, and even in the animal kingdom.The authors also attempt to identify the causes rape using mental illnesses or more particularily the personality disorders as a contributing factor. Other aspects such as the relationship of pornography with rape are investigated (and in the case of porn it appears that the almost explosive growth of porn in recent years is lowering rape incidence).The ending chapters list several areas where treatments have been tried with mixed results, and give several areas where additional research is indicated. This is a splendid work on the subject, and may remain the definitive work unless the directions indicated here point the direction to additional research.

>One of the best stories ever about the idiocy of warfare & the untrustworthiness of bureaucrats, diplomats & generals generally. On a moonless night, somewhere in the Circle Sea between Ankh-Morpork & Klatch, a strange & useless piece of land erupts, topped by a weathervane. Two fishing vessels are in the vicinity, competing for equally undesirable sea creatures (the Curious Squid, so foul-tasting that they are much in demand by the kinds of restaurants that sell nasty & undesirable seafood to their customers), & each claims the land for their own nation. Of course, Sam Vimes & the Watch are sent forth to fight for their nation, while the D'regs are ready to fight back. Watch out for Lord Rust & the Dis-organizer ("Bingely-bingely beep!").

>As a big fan of Rimsky Korsakov's operas (I have at least one audio recording of all of his operas and am collecting the DVDs as they slowly come along), I was looking forward to this production of May Night. I was disappointed. The recorded sound is poor (distant) and the production itself - sets and costumes - is quite odd.For me, decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the 1994 Saison Russe recording.We have been fortunate to have some of Rimsky's operas show up in good to excellent DVD productions: Le Coq d'Or, Sadko, Mlada, Tsar's Bride. Even the quirky and drastically cut Tsar Saltan of Harry Kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry. Let's hope a good Kitezh or Snow Maiden comes along at some point.

First time, including reading the instructions about 30 minutes, second time 15 minutes, winging it.All zippers worked smoothly. All parts fit flawlessly. Sizewise I took up about 1/3 of the floorspace with a queen-size inflatable mattress my son used about 1/4 so there was some room to stnd up and walk in the tent. A third person would have been doable but slightly cramped.Overall very satisfied with purchase!

I almost think he was trying to see if it's even possible to split that many characters at once.I think the last 4 books could be re-released featuring only a single character, and still might even be able to stand on their own, slightly. This sure isn't the old Conan stuff he did early 80's. but it's still better than the middle books

>MST3K's gag reel featuring episodes from seasons 2-6 isn't to be missed by any MSTie out there. The mess ups are also mess ups from everyone, for example, See Joel as he forgets his lines! See Trace (as Crow) lose Crow's arm and reach over to get it, see Tom Servo fall apart, see Mike as he "virtually" (you have to see it) messes up, and who can forget watching Frank crack up on the same line over and over and over and over again, I sure can't! The only flaw of this hilarous gag reel is that it is a half hour and I am sure there are more out there in seasons 2-6.However, overall it was a pretty good tape and worth any MSTie's money.

The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign.

>This was the first Parker book I ever read. I picked it up in an airport out of desperation when I had nothing left to read.While I liked it enough to read it through, and the story moved along, I found myself increasingly annoyed by the dialog. Every other line of banter spoken by the characters is a clever little quip. It's like they're all trying to be funny--all the time. It gets old quickly and has the effect of making each character sound exactly the same. They're all witty and full of one-liners.

>Eminem's music was not too bad, it could hardly be considered a punishable crime. However, his introduction of 50 cent into the world of music should see him stripped of all his possesions, shipped to a remote island and injected with enough anthrax to kill the entire population of Spain.Overall 50 Cents music has less musical credibility than The Backstreet Boys. He is catchy, that is all. MAYBE BSB went through a breakup and have experience int hat. 50 Cent on the other hand is a millionaire who acts like he lived on the street and was a "PIMP" (lets glorify a profession that abuses prostitutes! omg joy!).Rap is a genre that I do not particularily enjoy. Musically it is simple backbeats and lyrically oriented. 50 Cent makes rappers who can write intelligent lyrics look like gods.

Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest.

>This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's "Prose Edda", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture.

>The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far, one of the best presents we have received for our newborn son. My husband and I used it from the first day our son was born and at two months of age, he still falls asleep to this music. For a newborn, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is much better then any mobile as kids do not follow the moving objects until they are at least couple of weeks old but they do respond to sounds. The music is very soothing and will calm a crying baby in minutes. The downside - 15 mins of playing might not be enough so pressing the play button several times can be a pain expecially at night if you have a separate baby room. A remote control would be a great improvement.

>Anthrax was at the forefront of the speed/thrash metal movement, but while bands like Metallica and Megadeth achieved superstar status, Anthrax for some unknown reason dropped back. This collection will have those not familiar with the band wondering why that happened. Anthrax doesn't seem to take themselves too seriously (except when it comes to censorship issues), and, unlike others of the genre, have been blessed with frontmen who can actually sing! They are definitely a high-energy band as well, with just enough melody in their songs to keep things interesting for those of us who are not habitual moshers. "Attack Of The Killer A's" is a good overview of Anthrax's career, although I was disappointed that the sublime "Medusa" wasn't included. Crank it up and get dirty looks from your neighbors!

>A child's story, as in the harry Potter series where the heroes are very young. The witch craft is better explained if far fetched but I just suspend the irregularities and enjoy the story and the very adult themes. I have not finished the last book, The Amber Spyglass so I don't know who is going to get theirs in the end. Catholic church does take a drubbing but the very young heros and heroines are so unworldly that the author can sort of get away with it. I like the books,they are an easy read and not likely will be on the children's shelf in religious homes if the parents read it.

>I have only walked out of a handful of movies, and this was one of them. Everything about this movie was contrived and stilted. While Blake Edwards has produced some classic movies, this simply is not one of them. I recommend S.O.B if you're looking for a truly excellent Edwards film

>Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much. A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary: Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content. BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.

>I also read this book in college, more like 15 years ago for me. It was part of a Contemporary American Fiction course. Even then I found myself wondering if this was really the representative of the best than contemporary fiction could offer. If so, I was happy to stick with older works. While other reviewers remember lush scenes, I remember a sorid Hawaiian themed bar in NYC and the main character's rape with a plastic tiki. I can stomach rough scenes when they are purposeful. I found little of purpose in this story. I think there are far better uses for your book money than this book.

>I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests.

>This CD is good, BUT...if your a fan of their last several CD's this album can disappoint. Kamelot has not been Nickelback or Creed. This album tends to be more poppy, the guitars are a little more buried to the sound effects. It lacks some of the power and aggression of the last several releases. It still has some catchy tunes and good writing, but not quite the raw power of Karma or The Black Halo. I was hoping for more songs like "Momento Mori" or "Karma". It's just not on this album. It reminds me of Queensryches Promised Land...Sort of searching for identity...You may disagree..its a good CD, just not as passionate as previous releases to me...

>I enjoyed the first chapter of this book, but I felt a little misled when its content took a U-turn after that. The book begins with a father and son making a dangerous trek up an icy mountain during a skiing trip and accidentally finding a frozen,dead body. From there Evans weaves his elaborate story of how the body ends up on the mountain. The story is about how a cheating, middle-aged husband indirectly ruins the lives of his wife, son, and daughter (who is the body that is found on the icy mountain). By the end of the book, everyone has adjusted to being "dumped on" by the guilt-ridden husband's decision to leave the family, and they have no choice but to move on with their lives. This is nothing more than another classic story of immoral misbehavior involving a weak male character who can't improve his marriage and takes the easy way out by leaving.

>After listening to several other Celtic Christmas music selections on the web, I purchased the Celtic Christmas, Celtic Christmas II and Celtic Christmas III CDs. I'm here to tell you, I am VERY VERY VERY disappointed. The marketing geniuses at Windham Hill did an excellent job at creating these BOGUS Christmas CDs. They could just as easily named them Songs of Easter, or Songs of Summer Vacation or Songs of Thanksgiving. Of course, they'd have to rename a couple of the songs, but you'd never know it. I'd rate this a MINUS 5 STARS if I could. Don't buy either of these CDs unless you are looking for some off the wall type of Christmas music.

Lon Chaney, Jr. had a more varied diet and, according to Gregory William Mank's "It's Alive" (a terrific book about the studio's Frankenstein series), the son of the legendary man of a thousand faces was also a heavy drinker. Chaney is certainly heavy in "Son of Dracula," looking more like a football player than the king of the undead, and his miscasting sinks an otherwise sturdy chiller. The right mood is maintained throughout but the lack of a convincing Count all but demolishes the effort. Bela Lugosi, where are you?

>I remember as a kid reading the Foundation trilogy and being *so angry* about Asimov's literary "dirty trick" of revealing at the end that two characters that have previously been introduced in the book are actually the *same person*! When I read a book, I play a "movie" in my mind, so I could actually "see" those two characters, and they were clearly two different people, so to claim at the end that they were the same person seemed SO UNFAIR to me! Now as a (much older) reader, I read Prelude, and unsuspectingly DARNED IF HE DIDN'T PULL THE SAME TRICK ON ME!

>I could not imagine at first how anything by Neruda could rate lower than four stars, so I browsed some of the translated poems in this book and compared them with other translations. Most of the other reviewers are right. The English versions are unbelievably bad, and that's quite a feat because Neruda's verse is generally economical and unpretentious. I suspect that Babelfish could have done more justice to Neruda on some of these poems.A good alternative to this would be "The Essential Neruda: Selected Poems." It's a well-rated collection produced by a team of strong translators.

When I had too many out, he would knock them to the floor. He's 28 months old now. He doesn't make real words yet. But that's coming soon!But watch out for the fridge magnets.

>The original Bosch fuel pump died in my 1991 Saturn after 20 years of service. a Replacement part was $600, for a 20 year old car. No thank YOU! I replaced it with a Walbro pump, bought on Amazon. Let's be honest, dropping the tank and replacing the pump is not a fun thing to do and you don't want to do it again any time soon. In installing the new pump in the old housing it makes no sense not to replace the strainer as well, the old one in my car was yellow, somewhat brittle after doing its job for 20 years. Some fuel pump makers will not warrant the replacement pump unless you replace this part as well- I can understand that as it is not hard to imagine pieces of a disintegrating strainer being sucked up and constricting the pump mechanism. Hey, if you are going to spend money on a pump, and the time to pull it spend the few extra bucks to do it right so that you don't have to do it again soon.

(1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing "Snow" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she "runs" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!). Aside from all that, a real depressing movie.

>The premise of King's book is too good: a young girl lost in the woods, her furtive imagination going wild as she tries to find her way out. Unfortunately, the actual story is about as compelling as watching a 3 day cricket match. Who knows if King could have written it in a way to hold my attention, but as it stands, the story is dullsville. The best moments are when our heroine talks to Tom Gordon, but those are far and few between. Most of the book is written in a rather sophomoric way and many of the events in the story make you want to roll your eyes. A nice payoff at the end may have redeemed the book, sort of like a closer coming in in the ninth to save a losing game. But alas, this one will have to go in the "L" column.

I was unsure of what to make of them.As far as the Tom Bombadil character: What is his purpose? Is he symbolizing something or an error in the plot?A long work, yes? The films are visually extraordinary, but I wonder if NOT reading the books puts one at a disadvantage when seeing them (the films)."The Shadow of the Past" chapter is probably the best in this first book of the trilogy inasmuch as it explains a great deal of background.Personally I prefer the third book "Return of the King".

Wilder has a wonderful collection of sayings and lore here, and I never put down the book without thinking "I'm going to remember a couple more of those expressions and start using them." But be warned, the chapters and chapter titles seem to be mostly for decoration. They only loosely describe the rambling contents of each section. There is no index (at least in my edition), so relocating a particular express (now what was it he said about hot weather?) is a challenge. I almost always get distracted before I can find what I'm looking for. But I greatly enjoy what I find along the way.

But to hell with that, it's still a very, very fun ride, and I'll watch it many times. As to technical problems; it appears that the problems are with the players. This disc is one of the few to exercise this many features in the DVD standard, and some players (particularly older ones) can't handle it. My advise? Buy this disc and see if your player can handle it, and if it can't, get the maker to fix it; this would be a "quality of workmanship" error, since the disc DOES MEET THE DVD SPEC. Worth the price just to make sure your player is up to snuff. (FWIW, I think any new player can handle it).

Many complain about how her thoughts seem disjointed, but her writing style seemed to follow my own thought patterns, something that fuels the frustration of the disease even more. The book made me feel very fortunate to live in the 1990s, when sympathetic psychologists don't dismiss irrational feelings, and pills keep me from having to endure shock treatments or other such practices.

This stuff is pitch black, and best of all, it doesn't bleed or "feather" when you're writing with it.Works well in:Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen Assorted Ink 7-Pack Pouch (90029)

>The word "essential" is used alot in regard to records, but here it fits the bill and then some: it belongs in anyone's collection. I especially enjoyed hearing full-length versions of "Let Yourself Go", "Bring It Up", "Cold Sweat", and "Papa's...Bag"; the pre-edit "Money Won't Change You"; and the prev. unrel. tracks from '68 and '71. However, I was disappointed to note that some notable JB non-hits like "Georgia.." and "If If I Ruled The World", two concert staples, were omitted, and could have fit in if some long tracks had been used in "Part One" form.

>So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?

I look for films like this because, again, it was more about the disturbing (and somewhat depressing) story than 'the stuff that happens between the special FX'.Hollywood doesn't seem to make cool movies like this anymore (Except for "The Road")This wasn't the best film I've seen, but it was a welcome 'Change of pace' film, who's style seems to be disappearing. At least in the US.Spasibo and Do SvidaniyaJSIf anyone is interested, see if you can find (and watch) "Lilya 4-Ever" (or, depending where you look, "Lilja 4-Ever") w/ Oksana Akinshina ...it's a 'sad ...but very real' story

>Just a word or two about this Blu ray release of Cabaret....there seems to be a divided group regarding the reviews. I would say that this is a major improvement over the DVD release which was infamously bad....The blu ray transfer is really wonderful. It has a soft but very detailed image. The grain of the original film is still visible which is just how it should be. There are many dark scenes in the movie, but the blu ray transfer deals with them with great justice. Daylight scenes do appear to be better, but that is due to the sensitivity of the film stock of that time....Audio wise, there is a great improvement. Voices are central and in combination with left and right channels, a detailed and clean sound is produced. Surround channels provide a little back-up for the main musical numbers, but not much more. Again, a vast improvement over the original DVD.Well worth buying. Five Stars!!

>Take Raymond Chandler's noir "slumming streets" of 1940s Los Angeles, a few tough cops who may or may not be "on the take", more "dishy" dames than you can take a stick at all trying to make their way to Hollywood's big time, big screen any way they can. Throw in money, sexual desire, sexual perversion, some stolen scenes from other noir films and you have "Black Dahlia". No, not Chandler's "Blue Dahlia" there is too much visual, up-front violence, too little worthy dialogue, and too little character development for that but all the other elements are there to produce an some what entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing a little, if you can keep your eyes off those "dishy" dames, Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, (or, depending on your preference, those "dishy" guys ). That in the end is probably the reason to see this thing. It does have that great `40s background music to set the mood, though. You know, if you are a noir fan what I mean.

If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters.

>I've been a fan of Neil Young for almost 40 years, and I love many of his albums. This album is an anti-war effort, and for that I applaud him. In his songs, Neil has always tackled tough issues like war and the environment. However, the music is the most important thing, not the message, and all of the songs on "Living with War" sound the same. In fact, the songs on this album sound very similar to those on Greendale. Living with War has none of the beautiful melodies for which Neil is known and admired. The music is forgettable.

>Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious, but the story is not.

It's not good enough to have a good ides, you have to write well, too.

>This is the third Susan Elizabeth Phillips' books I've read. This was not the usual "stay up all night and read" kind of book. I found it slow getting into and hard to get interested in the characters. The book was complicated as far as characters go...Francie and her European ties/Dallie with ties to golfing and Holly Grace having been married to Dallie at one time and now Francie's best friend. It captured my interest midway in the book; however, after that I really thought it was good. If you are a devoted Susan Elizabeth Phillips fan, this is not her typical book. Her other works are great. This book is mediocre in my eyes.

>There's a lot of product for the price and the cleaning cloth is really soft and strong. The cleaner gets off finger prints and the other little specs that get on the screen. The downside is that it actually does streak. The streaks aren't too "heavy" but there is a lot of them. I've tried it on both of my screens (Acer and Asus) several several times. You can get a little bit of the streaks off if you use a dry part of the cloth and wipe the screen over and over and OVER. Really disappointed after reading the reviews. I may return this product.

The sequel is a bit like most movie sequels...not quite as interesting as the previous. The acting is still bad, the puzzles to some degree are almost identical in nature, and the storyline goes exactly nowhere. If you haven't played the 7th Guest, then maybe you'll like it, but I think I liked the music more on 7th Guest, so get that if you can.

>This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real "blowing" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion "smooth" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available.

>This moviecould be described as Cape Fear In The Ghetto - Jon Lithgow matching Robert Mitchum in the powerhouse acting department, though taking it over the top for Friday night movie crowd.Lithgow is a crafty thug who somehow becomes fodder for Washington's "15 minutes of fame". DW is a recent Law School graduate with a view towards making a career in Law enforcement. D.A. Lindsay Wagner sees the amateur video of Washington saving a hostage's life *and* saving the life of the perpetrator, so he can be brought to justice with no extra gunplay.Jon escapes from prison, reunites with his Arian Nation buddies, and sets out to do to Denzel what Denzel did to him - take apart his life, piece by piece.There is an abundance of witty dialogue and barbs at the media, which by 1991 had already joined the junk culture, with sensationalism where fairness and accuracy once prevailed.Will Styles (Denzel) makes his TV comeback?

More importantly, when we lay her down and press it on, the music signals to her that it is time for bed. She willingly rolls over to look at it and eventually falls asleep. She used to press it on herself in the middle of the night to go back to sleep(when her crib was lower and the aquarium was more accessible). I would reccommend this soothing toy to anyone and suggest to start using it early on. The only modifications I would make would be a remote control for parents to turn it on without entering the room(it only goes for 7 minutes) and maybe longer straps so that when the crib is lowered the baby can still reach it.

>This compilation has an edited version of "Figure Of Eight", which I believe is the same as the single version. There are two rarities on this CD which are worth the purchase to the serious collector; "Party Party" is a dance number, sounding pretty much from the era it was recorded in (late 1980s). "I Wanna Cry" is a slow, hard driving blues tune. Fairly sure these tracks were recorded during the "Flowers In The Dirt" sessions, since this disc was released around the same time. This was originally issued as a radio promo disc, and is indeed a rare find.

Pug, the omnipresent, clarevoyent, far-seeing, all knowing naval Captain, giving advice to world leaders who figuretively slap their foreheads while saying, "Pug, you're so right, why didn't I think of that ?

>Behind the Lines by W.E.B. Griffin is, in my opinion, one of his finest books in "The Corps" series. The seller shipped my audio cassettes of this book to me in an extremely prompt manner. Cassettes and the box were all in excellent condition.However, I cannot read all sides of the 4-sided tapes. The first two sides of each tape plays well in my 4-track cassette player, but the second and fourth sides require the use of a stereo player with two balance adjustments. To play the last two sides of the tapes, you must adjust the balance on the stereo player. I do not have a stereo player that accommodates cassette tapes and, therefore, cannot listen to the book. I am very disappointed about this and recommend t o prospective future buyers that they ascertain if the cassette tapes being ordered will work wit h their cassette players.

(...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption."3) The morality of Darwinism:"The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and "not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us."1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion.

>I was reluctant to invest in a blanket specifically for swaddling, but after a few weeks of making due with regular blankets, I tried the SwaddleMe wrap. While it is reasonably priced, cute and easy to use, my little guy found it easy to "escape", both from the size-appropriate blanket, and from the smaller size. I just couldn't keep his arms secure or tightly wrapped. Swaddling at night makes all the difference for my baby, so I'll continue to do it, but I'm back to my low-tech system: receiving blanket and tape.

>Very likable crisp and clear image - f/1.8 is more than enough for me. One thing I found weird is that when it is on manual focus, the photo does not always come out as expected. Auto focus works fine though - I guess I will just stick to AF - nothing much you can ask for for a lens this cheap.

>Even people jaded by the extreme "realism" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>My three year old son wanted a case for all of his cars, and although this case holds a lot it is very difficult to use. He has a hard time opening and closing the case and the plastic road pad came off almost immediately. The cars also fall out when you wheel the case around and then open it again. I think he finds it very frustrating, but he does seem to enjoy putting the cars in and out. I'm looking for a better case.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I've looked high and low for a version of this book, other than the mass market paperback edition. This book was too good to not have a proper quality paper back or hardcover edition on the market. One of my favorite L'Amour novels. This edition is a welcome volume to add to my library.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.

>Eragon is a fantasy novel written by Christopher Paolini. He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money.

>I have been playing Hold 'Em successfully for 10 years and finally decided to buy this book because I heard so much about it. It was not the best investment I've ever made.Sklansky and Malmuth are both very knowledgable about the game...odds, probabilities, etc. But they are not great writers (and they admit that in the beginning). The book is very boring...and not well written. Most of the info is common sense, but there a few pearls of wisdom.It is DEFINITELY not for a poker newbie. But if you have some time in at the tables and want something to read on the john, give it a shot.

>These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it

>These bulbs are noticeably better than those originally in the vehicle. The life span remains to be seen; hopefully longer than the tech rep indicated (1 year). Installation was easy.Additional information (1/7/2011): in the fall of 2010, the left bulb failed, yielding roughly two and one-half years of superior lighting. Regular bulbs seem to last far longer. Note that I don't drive much in the dark. Not sure that I would buy these again.

>The 'little' series is usually pretty good, but this is an exception I've found. My wife, wanting something less nasty than milk of magnesia to help our 2 year old have a bm, brought this home. "It tastes like chocolate" is what she said, trusting the label. Our innoccent son tried it and then choked and threw up. Poor guy. I tried it later.... man, was it nasty. It says to 'slowly' administer it to inner cheek. I don't think many kids would go for this. The only way would be mixing it into something already strong tasting and only a few drops at a time. The best is to modify diet and lots of fluids, but good ol milk of magnesia does the trick when you need it.

>I Just recieved this new phone. Features & Audio Quality are very Good. There is a little bit of echo as described by other Buyers. But my biggest complaint is the range. I only get about 40-50 ft. at best before this phone starts breaking up. Verydissapointed in the range of it in my house. My old uniden 900 SST went a block in a half for rang. This phone barely makes it out to my back Yard. If all the new 5.8 GHZ. are this way, thengive me the 900 Mhz. anyday of the Week. I hope Uniden & othermanufacturers are paying attention. Bob S.

>I have nothing to add to the glowing reviews that already make up the body of this catalogue. This book made the same sort of impression on me as a child that the Bible, Torah or Koran might make on a religious person.

>I just bought this laptop backpack so taht I could carry my powerbook along with books. I expected the laptop slot to be padded on the bottom, the most important place for padding since you put your bookbag down all the time. I always gently put the bag down...yet I still ended up getting a DENT in my brand new laptop. I've been carrying the laptop around in non-laptop bags, and haven't had any problems, so I expected no problems with a bag that was designed to carry a laptop.other than that, it's a pretty bag w/ lots of compartments, so it's great as a regular bookbag..but the laptop slot seems to do nothing.

>This cd has it all. Shakira does a great job writing plus each song has a completely different feel. On this cd there are virtually NO BAD SONGS. I've found only one song slightly boring and on occasion I do actually want to hear even it. Shakira has an awesome voice too that really reflects the moods of the songs. If you are still wondering about this cd than i have one more thing to tell you. I wouldn't say i don't like music but i am not a superfan that can't stand not having music on. A lot of times i buy a cd and listen to it for a month or two then never again. This is one of the cd's that is in my permanent folder. It just never gets boring.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>I liked this movie, not because it was a break from the originals but because it was what defined the series. Most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it! The first 2 movies never truly explained what the curse of Michael Myers was and how it came about! Nor did they emphasize on the history of Samhain like this one did! This movie attempts to explain that and Halloween 6 (Curse Of Micheal Myers) finishes it up! Try to read more into a movie, people, and not be so quick to judge!

>Ok, I don't want this to sound like all of the other reviews, so let me just say that J.D. Salinger really captures the essance of being a teenager. I was only 11 when I read it for the first time, I understood a lot and liked it for the superficial aspects of it. Now I'm 15 and can relate to Holden. I read this book for the third time about a month ago and I think this time I really understood what Holden was going through. I would also like to say to all of you who hate this book, its ok to hate it, but give Salinger some credit. He is a wonderful writter and even if you don't like his books, you should at least give him his credit.

>I was going to take my young kids to see this "family" movie. I was checking the showtimes and saw it was PG-13! I thought I'd better check it out. Now I hear that the coach is inside Hooters and singing "Cocaine", and there is a lot of swearing in the movie. Why? What is the point? I guess we'll have to pass on this one. Maybe we can rent the original instead.Another rant: The Fantastic Four is heavily advertised on kids tv channels and Burger King has Fantastic Four toys in the kids meals. (Kids meals are for kids 12 and under) The movie is PG-13! My kids have been wanting to see this, but again, I must say no.

>Although Shemin brings up many good ideas, I found that most of his ideas are way to cheezy for me (or Southern california.) He discusses buying places for $8,000-$20,000 (I wish) and believes that charging more for rent will ultimately get you higher quality tenents. I completely disagree, especially in down markets.A decent book, overall, but I'd suggest a Nolo book which has more real legal information as well as solid do's and don'ts for a landlord.

>Okay, here's the deal. I'm looking for a great way to study for the bar. A thirty or sixty day cruise sounded like a great option. I wouldn't buy it again though.Although this is a fairly entertaining read, It's a bit pricey - it's privately published so you're probably not going to find it at your local bookstore. I was disappointed by its size, scope, and overall treatment of the subject.Best bet: if you happen to see this book at a garage sale - pick it up. Don't pay full price - you'll be disappointed.

>If your looking at this level your serious about perfection. I've used this tool for a number of years now and never question its accuracy. I bought the level and a case for it, which I'm glad I did. A level of this quality needs to be protected. If I had a complaint it would be that the magnets are too strong. I know that seems stupid for a magnetic level, but someimes it is hard to remove from the surface.

>You could read my review on this writers book, Leaving Jeremiah, but he can't write. He just has no talent at it. For both books, he paid people to write good reviews. He's a nice kid, and my review is entitled "Know This Kid" because I've met him, and he's nice and good at music, but he can't write. I'm a kid who's actually wiriting a book, but isn't finished yet, and I'm careful to avoid sucking at writing like him.

>Hey you Roberts' fans, skip this book. I am a big fan of Roberts..ever since I read Honest Illusions ( best book ! ) I got hooked, but she should stick to what she does best, and that's contemporary romance. What's with this trend of romance writers (Lindsey, Coulter, Robards....) writing gross suspense thrillers in which the victim is ALWAYS a woman! Why advocate such brutality? I read a book as a past time. I enjoy a good suspense book like anyone else but draw the line at sicko stalkers.There is a difference between a suspense/mystery and brutal-violent suspense. I mean, the ending is so silly--it's as if Roberts had no clue who the stalker was till the very end. Very very weak. Is she even writing these? This one isn't worth it. Go read Jewels in the Sun. Now that one is fun. I am anxiously awaiting the second book in this new trilogy.

>Ricochet Mints are fantastic. Xylitol is great. I keep hearing about how terrible other artificial sweeteners are for you. These are great and are even good for your teeth!Beware: We got a bad batch that tasted rancid even though the expiration date was 2011. We've ordered these for years, and this time the candies were the wrong color and the surface wasn't smooth; the paper lining the can was rippled, as if it had gotten wet. Amazon would not accept a return, even though it was within 30 days.We contacted Emerald Forest and they made good on it. Such a relief, as we've been ordering Emerald Forest xylitol and xylitol products for years, and their products are great. Great customer service, too.

>By a friend's recommendation, I bought "what to expect when you are expecting". As she said, this is a "pregnancy bible". But I actually like this book -- "planning your pregnancy and birth" much better.This book is clear, well-organized, and practical. I have a busy schedule. Also my reading speed is fairly slow since English is not my native language. So I appreciate the conciseness and yet still completeness of "planning ...". On the other hand, "What to expect ..." book has 130 more pages with smaller prints. It's also hard for me to find related topics in "what to expect" book, which according to my very personal opinion, has too much information and has too much useless talk.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does...

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader

>I have the 11th printing (1991) edition. There are many words to learn and be amused. The first word is "abecedarian." The last word is "zzxjoanw." He recomends this word for Scrabble. Another word, found in the book, that he recommends for parlor word games is "aeaeae." Looks weird, doesn't it? He claims that this is the only all-vowel six-letter word known to him. Until I read the book, I didn't know of it either.The author is British and uses examples familiar to Brits. It would have been nice to include the pronounciation of every word. I did find one typo. But, of course, I cannot find it now.

>Very selective reporting on a subject of vital concern to everyone. The authors are so anxious to justify their feminist resentments that the narrative does not ring really true.

>The author seems to partly grasp the challenges (i.e. managed care, cash flow, office staff, family life, etc.) of a being a physician.

>I had to read this book for school and in my opion the book is not in any way enjoyable or outstanding. It is supposed to be about a young boy maturing but the few changes that happen to him in extent of about two years are subtle and unimportant. He does learn about death although through the red pony (why is that the title of the book when the pony is only mention in the first two chapters then forgotten?). This book merely sleeps along drifting slowly and clumsily between chapters. It would have been much better if it went more into depth of the little boy's parents' and grandfather's history. Why Gitano, the old man who lived in an adobe house near the farm, went into the mountains is not told leaving you to make up your own conclusion. The only part of the book that stands out is the grandfather's speech at the very end of the book about westering and how the times have changed.

>I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked. The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop. So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space. I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days. Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems. It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it.

>I knew I liked the Linkin songs when I heard them on the radio. I did not expect that I would like the CD as much as I do. As strange as this sounds, I got the cd about a month ago, and have had it on continuous loop the entire time. My CD player died, so I had to start using my computer to play it now. Its been on 24/7 for almost a month. I still don't get tired of the songs, they are utterly unbelievable and their replayability is unlimited IMO.

>It's just a toy. I'm annoyed with both sides of the argument. It's not from the devil and it's not "to be used by only the very cautious". Y'all need to stop watching so much Charmed.Had this board for several years. Used it maybe 3 or 4 times a year. Didn't notice any wear or tear on it except for the squishy padding that goes on the bottom of the planchette seems to fall off pretty easily.This isn't a sort of game where you can rate it based on whether or not it "works". It's just a piece of cardboard. The only legitimate review would be an address of the quality of the materials.Never had fraying problems, personally, so i'd give it a 4 out of 5 only because it IS cheap materials.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>Paradox, the first book in this series, was chock-full of ideas and story. There was some violence, but it advanced the story. Context, the second book, had fewer ideas and more violence. Resolution is chock-full of blood and gore, and very little story.It does explain how the world got the way it was, but the explanation feels pro forma. The main character becomes more and more cardboard - painted in lurid colors. The action is also lurid, and the reader's emotions are force-fed.I'm sorry I read it. Read Paradox - it's really quite good. Maybe read Context. But if you like Context less well than Paradox, don't read Resolution at all - just go online and find a plot summary with spoilers.

>I got this product to keep my neighbor's pesky dog out of my goddamned garden!I coated some of my seeds with this stuff before I planted a recent carrot patch. As expected, the dog came and ate all of the carrots. I expected him to get sick or at least no longer enjoy the carrots due to their Uranium nature, but he loved it! He continued to eat the carrots, visibly growing as he ate them. He left my garden at least 6 inches taller and with a spryness I have never seen out of the damn old mutt. I watched this scene from my window with horror and I still am not sure what to do about this. At night I can see a faint green glow coming from the neighbor's doghouse which I assume is a result of my carrot shenanigans.I only gave this product 2 starts because it grew, overnight, the largest carrots I have ever seen. They were 2' long and a vibrant orange that I have never seen before.

>I love Disney flicks and so does my four year old; this is why we purchased this, he saw the video in the store and a trailer on another movie and it looked like another great Disney movie for kids and adults alike and it does have a great ending, but to get there you have to sit through countless attempts to kill the fox by the hunter and his dogs. There are numerous scenes where the hunter is shooting his rifle at just about any and everything. I am not against hunting, however, I do not feel this movie is appropriate for young children who do not understand "Why this guy is trying to kill everything Daddy"

>My dogs hate this product and will go to their deaths before they'll use it. They fought me tooth and nail to get it off.I wss walking my dog with it on because he's high-strung and gets to aroused at what he sees. I though the calming cap would gentle him down a bit. It didn't help much. Instead of barking at everything, he used his time to try to get the darn thing off!People walking by, grabbed their small dogs and ran when they saw a sixty-pound pit bill wearing this thing.In my personal opinion, it was not a winner.

>I have been using this for more years than I can remember. I can no longer buy it locally so I buy it when I am in LA, however,I ran out & really missed it as I have dry skin. I didn't want to bother anyone there to send it so I went online & found you notonly carried it, but at a cheaper price than I usually pay, & you ship free. I tried other brands but none compare to theVitabath.

>I brought this CD because my father was a member of The Flairs, (Ermines, Ebbtones.) He sings the lead on the song "I'd Climb the Hills and Mountains." and presumably background on the other song included. More than buying it for the songs or to reminisce, I purchased it to hear how my dad sounded during the brief (55-57) years he had with that group.If you are a true doo wop group afficionado then I would add this to my collection. Unfortunately it's not the best of the best the era had to offer, mostly it's people who were trying to find their way, but didn't get the right songs or lineup together. At the very least it's a good musical history review.

>I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire. It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised.

>On the cover of my book it says "Her (Iris Murdoch) wise, witty and compulsive novel. I have spent many hours of my life reading a wide variety of "important" authors, and finally got around to reading Iris Murdoch. The fact that IM is a philosopher was an added attraction to me.What to say. The only one word description of this novel that comes to my mind is "pedestrian". It was an easy read. It had a few interesting people in it, and they had various issues in need of resolution. The story moves along at a good pace, but something is really lacking. I am sorry, but I did not find it "wise, witty and compulsive". I found it to be a plain, uninspired narrative.Perhaps I picked the wrong Murdoch book. I'll try another one soon.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Mas Amedda was always one of the more interesting aliens in the prequels. This figure gets pretty high marks. The only thing I would like to see in a future update is a soft goods outer cloak.

>Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues. Se habra quedado con tao'chien? se habra reconciliado con Miss Rose? Eso nunca lo vamos a saber!

>I tried to read it, but I couldn't. I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of "as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors.

>Akira was a film I had wanted to see all through my childhood. When I was 6 or 7 my brother rented it from Blockbuster. He wouldn't allow me to watch since he said it was for adults. The next day he confronted me and told me the film would traumatize me. At the time I didn't understand how a cartoon could be as disgusting as he described to me, but to keep safe I stayed away from it. Last year I finally rented it on DVD after hearing all the hype about it. It blew me away. It was fantastic. I loved it so much I bought it and added it to my collection. I usually don't like really violent films but this had a plot to support the movie with so that the film didn't collapse at the end. I don't want to give anything away, but watch the movie and if you loved it, read the 2,000 page comic book it's based off of.

>Released on April 29, 2003, this is a solid retrospective of the textures and avant-garde work from the 1970s, with solid rhythms that keeps the focus on the technological aspects now found in the studio.The 10 numbers - clocking in at 71:01 - were designed for a Japanese/American co-produced documentary, which apparently has never been released. The music stands alone and demonstrates that Edgar Froese does not have to cruise through releasing "updated" albums, remixes and live material from the vast TD archives.

>'The Great Santini' is a compelling drama superbly produced, written, filmed, directed and acted (in it I think Duvall gives his finest performance, and he's ably supported by everyone in the cast). Unfortunately, the DVD release in "full-screen" format cheats viewers of the fine cinemaphotography and thus of the impact of the whole effort: thus I rate the disc two stars and recommend against buying or renting it.About a month ago on late night television - on one of those high-numbered UHF stations - I saw the widescreen version of this film and this version begs to be transferred lovingly to widescreen DVD.

>If you are the mother of young children, or homeschooling your youngster to do art, then this is quite possibly the book for you. Assuming you have little or no knowledge of drawing, it takes you through the basics, in easy, child-level steps. I've used it with my little boy, and he's showing great talent, at least according to this book - it's hard to tell at this age. Book seems a bit limited, though, but at least for my boy the level of language is usefully simple.

>This is a great classic movie, and as today is my first day with Amazon Prime, I decided to watch an older movie since the newer movies were running too slow for good video. My internet consistently runs at around 20 Mbps, and I can't even stay connected to the server for this nearly 30 year old movie. I don't have this problem with Netflix or Hulu. If this is indicative of the service quality coming out of Amazon, my prime membership won't even last for the 30 day trial period.

>When I took the unit out of the box I was impressed by the predictable stylings of the KitchenAid machine - until I used it. The feed chute is so small that it takes me 15 minutes to make my juice in the morning. My daughter in law bought the cheaper one from Amazon.com about a month ago called the Juice Fountain. Although I haven't heard of the brand, the unit is very nice looking and it is about 5 times faster to use. I am new to juicing, and don't know if other juicers are like the Kitchenaid, but this really seems to be very slow and labor intensive. It makes great juice and I feel better for drinking it, but I wish I had have bought the cheaper unit.I still have my Kitchenaid mixer and love it dearly, but in my mind, they don't have what it takes in juicers.

>Is does make a lot of noise , it stays warm when pluged in so I unplug it . Coffee builds up between the base unit and the ground hopper in the upper side of the output area. Keep that area clean (like once ever 2 month ) and it will not dust your counter . In other words you are not seating the ground hopper in properly . Oily beans do seem to plug it up a bit using fine grind settings .I just noticed these reviews while hunting for a new grinder . I was getting a replacement prior to my attempt of clean this machine I was afraid it might die while under the screwdriver . I didn't even know it could be broken down for cleaning . So if it doesnt live through the cleaning I wanted a back up grinder that not a panic buy . Its also over 3 years old now it can not last forever (used 2 time each day ) . I make coffee on the stove with a paper filter using setting 2.5 and the coffee comes out like flour .

>It's a remarkably bright, handy little flashlight. Perfect for my key chain. Too bad it stopped working after a few months. I took it apart and as far as I can tell there is a disconnect somewhere in the head assembly. I can't figure out exactly where. It bugs me because the switch still works and the LED still works and the case is solid. A lot of these small flashlights have a flaw like this - they work well for some months and then the cheapest part goes bad and you have a machined aluminum sculpture for your junk drawer.I also have a Fenix LD10 which is holding up nicely. It's brighter than a full sized Maglight.

>Casual fans stay away, this is for the harcore Motorhead fans only. This is a horrible representation of one of the greatest bands of all time. This album sounds like a bootleg that some no-name label got a hold of & decided to cash in on the Motorhead name. This CD is for serious completists only as it has the classic Motorhead line up of Lemmy, Phil Taylor, & Eddie Clarke. If you are looking for a good live Motorhead album, I suggest one of their official releases. Such as "No Sleep Til Hammersmith," "No Sleep at All," "King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Motorhead," or "Everything Louder Than Everyone Else."

>I installed the Viking Weather Resistant Door box to allow me to answer the door bell without having to open the door. The installation does take some knowledge of wiring basics, but overall fairly simple. It is designed to be connected to a spare line on a two line telephone so you can answer the door box from any phone (even cordless) that has a spare second line. The benefit is enormous, not only for dealing with door-to-door salesmen, but for not having to walk from the back yard to see who's at the door. This would be very handy for any handicapped person. This is a must for the security conscious. Viking products have been used by the Telephone Industry for many years and are very reliable.

The songs, most of which are rap songs, are really cute and amusing. The instrumentals are similarly "cutesy", and almost all of them are under a minute long (a few are less than ten seconds long).

>I have used this product for years and love it. It's great for semi-permanent and permanent repairs with absolutely no degradation from the elements (weather). It can be removed without a sticky residue. Duct tape leaves a horrible sticky residue and the adhesive starts to degrade over time. Unfortunately, this plastic tape is becoming very hard to find. Also, it use to come in a 3/4 inch width in clear but I can't find that anymore.

>I wish I had researched better before making my purchase. This card can't seem to keep up with my camera once it reaches a certain level way below its 16GB capacity. It becomes slow to write and that is not good from some of the situations I find myself in. I probably will shop around, ask some experts and invest in a more expensive card. If you are shooting 2-3MB photos and not shooting HD video, you will be fine and the price is great for that.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>Very disappointed. For the price I thought it would be comprehensive, but too many perennials in common usage are not included. Also, no visual distinction in writeups between description and how-to-grow, so you have to do a lot of reading to zero in on the information you want. What I like about it is that the author provides opinions as well as descriptions, the photos are very good, and the information helps you choose among perennials and among their varieties.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>Despite some good reviews I'm sorry I got this set. I'll never use the case. Only the camera will fit in it, and I need to be able to carry the extra battery. The neck strap is scratchy and even has a label warning it might irritate your neck - plus, it lacks the little tab thingy on the wrist strap that came with the camera, which gives you some help getting out the memory card or the battery if you have big fingers.Finally, the case has a magnetic clasp - I don't claim to be knowledgeable about how much magnetism a memory card can stand, but I do note that the instruction manuals all warn against getting the card near a battery.

>Yup...Dad, my good conservative Republican father, told me the world worked just this way, but I wouldn't listen. Surely, I thought, people wouldn't do this to each other on purpose.I don't know how to respond to reviewers who doubt the credibility of Confessions. No red flags were raised to me, but then again, I have no background in the field.All I know is that this book was a riveting read. I could not put it down. And, with due respect to other reviewers, you do not have to be a paranoid leftie to think the world operates like Perkins describes. Not by a long shot.

>I too prefer a letterbox (widescreen) transfer over a full screen one because the letterbox format is the way you see the movie in a theater. However unlike the widescreen movies of the 50's & 60's you don't lose any picture for fullscreen versions of recent (70's & after) movies. For the older movies they had to pan & scan the image to fit the screen and you lost part of the picture that way so you buy the letterbox version to get the full image. But today they just open up the matte meaning you see stuff at the top & bottom that you didn't see in the theater. Sure I bought this full screen disc. It was agood way to get two great movies for the one low price. Not all double movie (2 on one disc) sets are full screen. I've bought some (like The Fugitive/US Marshalls) where both movies were in letterbox format. Oh & for these sets they are flipper discs meaning one movie per side of the disc. A great way to get a pair of movies!!

>Works well for a sifter of flour and such. However, don't try to sift something like Bisquick (which I think you really shouldn't do anyway) --- your efforts will be futile! I like the fact that it has a lid on both ends so that when you're filling it, you don't spill flour all over the counter pouring it in (leaking from the bottom). Very durable and sturdy; much better than those that are much less expensive AND cheaply made.

>Slavery was widespread through the Inca and Aztec cultures. Islam embraces slavery without reservation, it is expressly approved in the Koran. Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their home by Islamic traders from 700 A.D. to 1900 B.C. Mohammed left many pages of directions to SLAVEHOLDERS on how to handle their slaves. The Ummyad dynasty of Islamic rulers castrated male Black African slaves and used them in battle between 700 A.D. and 1200 A.D.By the way, where does one find a successful, stable, democratic non-capitalistic society? Planned economies don't work.

>I had to read this book for a college course and having to consistently "prove" the author right became very difficult. The author tries to discuss minority inequality, while dominantly discussing blacks and whites, leaving other minorities to unfairly fend for themselves. The author is a rough feminist out to prove her specific agenda without being well rounded or offering multiple sides to an issue. Furthermore, this book is quickly growing out-of-date. Great topic, but I'd recommend searching for a more balanced and informative author.

>OK, maybe not. Having produced Carmen, one of the major theatrical works of the 19th century, The Pearl Fishers will probably never be considered Bizet's greatest work. Yet for sheer sensual beauty, it's hard to think of a work that can rival it. From the famous, knock-out duet for tenor & baritone in the first act to the rousing chorus that ends Act II, and the nostalgic return of the duet in the concluding scene, it's one gorgeous moment to the next. I bought this recording on the strength of other reviews here at Amazon: it's a fine document of a beautiful score.

>I understand that fans all over the world are happy about having the oppurtunity to read books about their favorite band. However, how is it possible that a biography is written about three adolescent boys who have yet to live the bulk of their life. Understandably, their lives have been anything but common to the "common child," however, their lives are very similar to that of a child star. I do commend this book for being the only OFFICIAL Hanson book, and should probably be the only allowed on the market. Unauthorized books print false information that fans know is false. I also commend this book for being the only one that Hanson had something to do with. Of all the books available to fans, I would recommend this one of any, however, I think it may be a little pre-mature to publish ANY books about three children.

>As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others.

>A good source for minute information, this book functions better as a reference book than a comprehensive take on 18th century London. Readers should be advised that the first few chapters are heavy on the development of bridges and neighborhoods and such, yet there are no accompanying maps. If you are good at picturing how one lane leads into another and so on, this will be a delight. I found it extremely frustrating.The other immediate and annoying aspect is that, as other reviewers have correctly noted, Ms. Parks is no Johnsonian. Those who unluckily appreciate the Life do not understand his conversation for what it was - "bad manners." I feel that she uses his name to sell a work that could otherwise stand on its own. (Or maybe as "Horace Walpole's London.") In any case, those expecting to find the comfort and familiar parlance of the big guy are going to be sorely wanting, as I was, for the late, great Mary Hyde.

He DOES run out of bullets for it and his handguns. As for the rocket launcher part...I'm sorry, the explosion/back blast would have killed all three of them in the room when it went off!

>I'm like a lot of old horror movie buffs that have purchased 2nd rate copies of the rare classics because that's all that was available. And it wasn't the poor duplication process, it was the poor surviving master tapes that gave us an often fuzzy vision. You could call it horrific for the "Devil Bat" until the Roan group took charge. What you will get is a fantasically remastered version of a Bela "must have". I was taken aback by the quality of the newly mastered version on this DVD. Kudos also for the "Scared to Death" remaster that shows Bela in his colored glory. Although it's not in as good a shape as "Devil Bat", it's not bad and considering the lack of attention to early film preservation. Highly recommended.

>I liked the look of this set (horizontal styling) and that the clip was on top of each roller.They don't call it "DUAL HEATING TECHNOLOGY" for nothing. Each time I grabbed a hot roller it not only burns your hair, it burned my hands!I bought this setter because it appeared to have the type of clips I'm looking for. I found the clips hard to HOLD OPEN while my almost burned hand was trying to hold the roller in place for it.My current set up is my old clairol flocked set which uses metal clips. I have since purchased a bag of the plastic clasps that work great, but wanted ones that actually "go" with the setter. So far I haven't found good clasps with a new setter. Seems simple enough.Someone told me to try babybliss (sp)?I've been using hot rollers for 25 years without ever getting burnt if that helps.

>(Ordered two months ago.) The patch itself is about four inches from top to bottom. It comes in a clipped bag and is easily applied to any shirt, hoodie, etc. You basically leave a heated iron on top of it for a good 20-30 seconds before it stays compressed. Overall, the item looks pretty much how it does in the image provided (click and you can see the actual size). What you see is what you get. Pretty decent purchase. I never consider myself a hardcore anime/manga fan (otaku) - like some - and I don't have massive collections of such on my wall, but this patch was simply a trinket I purchased since Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the few manga I've actually read so far. Might wear off from time to time, but nothing another good, ol', steaming iron can't fix.

My original review I have left intact above. A couple of weeks ago these developed crackling, then one side went out entirely. In spite of multiple efforts, that side has remained in-operable, hence the new 2 star rating.

I'll give it one for good graphics and environments, but it was just too easy! You could flip through the levels in at the maximum in three days. What the hell is that? It's not at all challenging, and you can only play as Frodo, Mithrandir, and Elessar. If you want a good Lord of the Rings game, then buy the ones made by EA games. They are more challenging and cooler. This game is best for a seven-year-old. In conclusion, do not buy this game, but buy EA's version.

>When I tried to install on our Windows-7 PC I got an error message saying it was not compatible with 64-bit Windows.Doing some research it seams that this is truly "classic" software designed for old 16-bit systems. Windows is only backward-compatible one generation... so 16-bit software will work on 32-bit windows (usually) and 32-bit software will work on 64-bit windows (usually), but 16-bit will NOT work on 64-bit.The good news is that if you have Windows-7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate you can install "XP-Mode" which will let you run windows-xp as a virtual machine. You can then install this in XP and run the program that way. The really nice thing is that you can make a shortcut from the program inside the virtural-XP and place it on your Windows-7 desktop and it will appear to run like any other normal program. Setting this up took about a half-hour (after 15 min or so to download the installer).Here is the link to download XP-Mode: [...]

So if you into traditions this could be for you.

>What a let-down. Like another reviewer, when I finished reading this book, I said "Huh?" There are so many loose ends, you have to wonder if there is a sequel. Realizing that the next novel does reintroduce Joseph immediately, I will eat my words if Joseph, in his trench in France, suddenly decides to reflect on his parents' murders, etc. and fills in all the unanswered questions. Actually I had wondered if somehow I had missed something, but now I see from other reviews that, indeed, lots of things were never explained. As a lover of mysteries, (...) leading you along and then stabbing you in the back. Like others, I thought the book bogged down in rambling philosophy, but I kept going, hoping to find solutions.In fairness, there were one or two interesting philosophical comments: Sebastian's belief that it really matters what you leave behind, "...it's your thanks to the past, your love of the present, and your gift to the future."

It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/.

I find the forensic details of her books, this one particularly, fascinating. However, I think that Scarpetta's choices of not having any life are becoming old. I can't believe that a woman of this strength could be so helpless about having a life outside of work, and in finding SOME happiness someplace.

The earlier prequel series, (Houses Atreides, Harkonnen, Corino) was at least interesting and added something to the Dune mythology. I looked forward to reading them.This book promised to provide the prehistory of much of what is only alluded to in the prior books. It "delivers" that in a leaden style, with obvious plot lines, stilted dialogue, and a really boring story. And, as we find out only when we buy (or borrow) the book, it's really the first of a new three-book prequel series. Thanks, Kevin and Brian, but no thanks. I bought this book and read it. I don't plan to buy any of the others.

>I am new to the subject, merely indulging a writerly fancy at this point, so I found the chronology of events to be fascinating. A more responsible account of the Ripper crimes would have sufficed. Sadly, this effort is disturbing not so much by the crimes it details ( which are horrific in themselves) but that it adds one more victim to the Ripper massacres some 120 years later-- that of the brilliantly complex Victorian painter Walter Sickert. The underlying nausea one feels in reading this polemic, is that one is complicit in the wholesale libel of an historical figure by an ambitious, naive and astonishingly self righteous amateur with no compunction or shame about her misdeeds. The underlying notion that such a hatchet job can done by anyone at anytime to anyone does not sit well in this writer's psyche. In the end one cannot feel but violated and deeply mortifed for the Sickert family legacy.

>Beatrice di Tenda is one of Bellini's most under rated operas. It was written right after Norma and right before I Puritani, his two greatest masterpieces. Unfortunatly, after a poor reception at its opening it was never really given many chances to catch up with its sisters. It was only after Sutherland gave these historic performances in the early 1960's that the opera was re-born. Today it is a rare opera to hear but a treasure to listen to if ever given the opportunity. This recording is terrific, Sutherland is in top form. The only problem is the pace of this performance is too slow and just doesn't sound, to me, like true Bellini. Much better recording are with Joan Sutherland and Pavarti (1966 Decca). Or with June Anderson (opera d'oro 1987), either of these give Beatrice the proper seat beatween her sisters Norma and Elvira.

>As several other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous faults with this book: the Persian font is too small and cramped, the dictionary is not comprehensive, and the lessons do not necessarily proceed in the most logical fashion (e.g., why do we learn inseparable pronouns before we learn actual pronouns). Moreover, this book suffers from having a non-native author. As someone else mentioned, there are quite a few grammatical errors, or usage of the wrong, or lesser used preposition.The books merits, though, are the careful explanation of how to make the Persian letters. It is also somewhat useful if you have learned Farsi in the classroom, and need some backup as to certain rules (such as how to form plurals). But for the beginner, I'd recommend the Lonely Planet guidebook as a more comprehensive and easier introduction.

>I'm really enjoying this crock pot. What an easy way to cook! It's a beautiful design, different from typical crock pot look, but it is larger than it looked in photo on screen, but that's not bad, it holds plenty of food that way. Easy to clean, plastic storage lid very useful, can't wait to be able to take it to a pot luck. The programmable function could really be improved upon. I wish I could put in the hours I want at the level I want, instead of it automatically choosing high or low based on the time. I have cooked everything on low, and so far it has taken less time than all the recipies have called for, but the food has been delicious.

>This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.

>This is a reprint of a book first issued in 1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a "practical handbook."

>This is probably the greatest collection of the worst movies of all times. All are the creations from the mind of Ed Wood. Most people may remember the movie of Ed Wood's life with Johnny Depp as the title role. While that was played for laughs and some pathos, the real story was not too far away. Ed Wood had a true passion for making movies. He just did not make good ones. These are all fun to watch and have a laugh at, but understand that the intent was serious movie making. It might be somewhat sad to watch the declining years of Bela Lugosi, though. Get this set to watch and have fun with.

>Savage Garden's follow-up to the brilliant debut album is disappointing. The sound is very commercial and is the type of album that will become very dated in years to come. The title track 'Affirmation' is a good example of this as well as 'Animal Song'. America seems to love this band, but once you've heard our newest group 'Killing Heidi' you'll wonder why you fussed over this group.

>The third book in the "Madeline" series, this focusses on the wild behavior of Pepito, a troublemaking boy who is meant to be a foil for the mischievous Madeline. The behavior shown is pretty excessive, though: Bemelmans shows the boy tying a cat up in a pillowcase and releasing it into a pack of dogs, which strikes me a way too violent. Certainly not appropriate for smaller (toddler) readers. Even if you liked the other Madeline books, you might want to think twice before picking this one up. It's a little scary.

>All of the "Love" songs were delightfully sung and fun. Cinematography was often dizzying. At times the film was like a trip back to the acid-tripping 70s. Weird. Moments of greatness mixed with tediously dizzying camera work. If you love Nicole Kidman, you'll love it. She's beautiful and charming. As Satine, she sings quite well,(sounding something like Helen Reddy)even though she's in the throes of TB. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo were engaging and quite believable.Generally, a strange creative attempt. But I do admire Baz Luhrman for trying to bring his vision to life.

Get Bing, Armstrong and Frank all in a movie and you know there's going to be thrice the interruptive crooning (or jamming). Perhaps you have gathered by now that I am not much of a musical fan. For a good musical, watch Mary Poppins, the Sound of Music, or White Christmas. They have good strong stories with songs as accents.

>If ol' Mike Score could have only ditched the seagull haircut and re-invented the look of the group, this band might have maintained the status which acts like the Police and U2 and Bowie have managed to maintain, and their claim to fame with younger people wouldn't be that Adam Sandler movie. Only, they wouldn't have been the Flock then, would they?Check out "I Ran" but also "Nightmares", "Wishing", and "Space Age Love Song." In my book, the Flock is a prime example of what can happen when you mix genius artistry with an inability to reinvent itself. But then again, that implies that an artist needs to sacrifice his or her integrity in their art to alter themeselves and land public success. Hm.Either way, look forward to another project guys.

>Years ago, I did a fairly extensive "taste test" of all of the major protein powders on the market. Every single one disappointed me: they were either too expensive, tasted terrible, didn't mix up well, or usually some combination of all three. This was the first powder I found that would mix perfectly (PERFECTLY) in a simple shaker (no blender needed!), tasted just like chocolate milk (the other flavors are lacking for me), and was very reasonable per scoop. Lately, the price on this has ratcheted higher and higher, but I'm not ready to start hunting for a replacement. It fills me up as a post-workout shake!

It is about a woman who graduates from college and wants to be a writer for the New Yorker, but takes a job as an assistant to the editor of a fashion magazine to get in to the business. But her boss turns out to be an evil, horrible, horrible, nasty, stupid woman you love to hate. And hilarity ensues. It has some very funny parts, but is not totally fluff. It is a light read, but not so shallow as a typical harlequin.I have hand sold at least 20 of these and everyone I've given it to has loved it. Kudos to Lauren for reaching the best seller list on her first attempt. It is well deserved.

>It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular "The Ten Minute Guitar Workout", "Basic Guitar Workout", and "Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other.

When I upgraded I got LONG boot times, checking for updates was very CPU intensive and ZA would bring my machine to its knees at various times. (This is a P4 with 1Gb of RAM). Interestingly the same version of the software worked FINE on my P3 laptop so ... apparently these performance issues were the result of some kind of resource conflicts I could never track down. I was ready to uninstall and switch to Norton or someone else but found a newly released version on the ZA website V 7.0.462.000.For me at least this new version fixed all of my performance issues and I am back to being a happy ZA customer once again.

>I have 20 and 24 inch bicycle type wheels on a number of pony carts and carriages that I use for training ponies and carriage drivers, covering around 50 miles a week. The roads and trails in the area have all kinds of sharp objects, from thistle thorns to nails, wire and glass shards, that regularly puncture standard pneumatic tubes. Even adding Slime does not help when six thorns attack a tire. No-Mor Flats inner tubes have removed the problem, and I do not have to avoid previous danger areas. I have recommended that clients who use similar vehicles fit No-Mor Flats tubes, and some have already purchase them from Amazon.com. They are much easier to fit than the instructions on the box indicate, but you need to order a tube that is exactly the same size as the tire it is to fit.

>A "Dummies" book--especially on a topic as subjective as politics--should present a clear, unbiased foundation of the subject matter, taking pains to flag opinion from fact. This book is dangerous because it is targeted at the uninitiated, and because the biased opinion of the author is presented casually as matter-of-fact information. Hence, the reader walks away with a headfull of propaganda mistaken for fact.It's always a good idea to read about the author (you can do so in the editorial reviews page for this book) before delving into an unfamiliar topic. For a book like this, I strongly recommend it.

It makes a great after "Norm" snack. Try it. but note: it will give you a bad case of indigestion, if you eat and go to bed right afterwards. so, make sure to stay awake and up for a while, to avoid this symptom. OK?

Needless to say the other brand didn't work. We live next to a cattle pasture and the flies are outrageous near our home. I hung the "other" brand fly trap on the fence between the pasture and my driveway and a week later there were a few flies in the trap. I ordered the Rescue Brand Fly Trap from Amazon and hung 3 of them on the same fence. 3 days later I had to replace the Rescue Brand TrapsRESCUE!

>This book, in the Kindle format, is one of the later books in the Tommy and Tuppence series. Agatha Christie does not break up the original grouping of characters, so even Arthur is brought back to play a pivotal role for all that it was not the highlight of the book. Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do.

>When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a "true warrior". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.

>I didn't know what to expect with this cd. Eno tries everything! I have always loved his catchy hooks, infectious rhythms and thought-provoking (or mind-numbing) lyrics.This cd is not ambient music, and it is not some form of heady satirical/lyrical rock. What it comes closest to is his take on minimalism, as apparently repetitive patterns are laid out, but slowly transform in different ways (not so repetitive after all!). It isn't dance music exactly, since it isn't that intense -- but it isn't entirely vacuous either. In my opinion, it's a welcome in-between: music to drift in and out of, while doing something else. I can sink into it at moments, or let it go on without me. It sparks my imagination without dominating my thoughts, and that's just what I was hoping for when I bought it.

>I am usually not a fan of the nu-metal/rap-rock movement at all, but this is a good CD. This is much more than Limp Bizkit garbage, these guys actually have lyrics that are...somewhat meaningful. The idea of having two vocalists sets this band away from the crowd, both vocalists are good, and they both have different strengths and weaknesses, which makes this album rare in the fact it has good rap AND good screaming in it. One thing about rap rock that is dissapionting is some vocalists can be great singers, but their rapping voice is horrible, which can greatly degrade an otherwise decent album. All of the songs on this CD are at least decent, except I really dislike track 10. Besides that, this is a great CD and it can be enjoyed by alot of people.

>The striking thing about this animated picture is the paint work. Every detail of this movie is an art itself. I also read a review in which was mentioned that Don Bluth could not match Disney. I just think that the Don Bluth's style is somewhat different then Disney's. In spite of the splendid qualities of the disney movies I prefer to watch Don Bluth's animated movies because they are truely artistic. The colours and warmth are much more intense and the scores are better too. I do not have scores of disney movies but I do have scores of Don Bluth's movies. The 'Secret of Nimh' and 'the Land before time' are unbeatenable. Both the movies and the movie scores are 'must to have'.(By the way, the European version of Secret of Nimh is widescreen)Greetings from the Netherlands

>After hearing the debut album from Fischer's latest project Triptkon I thought wow I have to check out that Apollyon Sun side project and see what that was all about. I was psyched to find it for a mere two bits brand new from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers. I must admit I am glad that is all I paid for it. It just sounds like a poor White Zombie album to me. I think that Celtic Frost (especially the last line up) was top notch and Triptykon has a great future I believe. I know that this was a side project of Tom's and he admitted it was different from his normal style. I gave this one the 40 minute elliptical trainer test on my ITouch at the gym and it didn't keep me pumped although I still finished! I know some reviewers mentioned NIN and other bands that I have heard that this does sound more like and I realized I don't like those bands so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like this one either.

>Elmer Smith's new book is as interesting as his dry, uninspired journalistic pieces he has been writing for the last 20 years in the Philadelphia Daily News. I don't understand how Elmer's writing or his view on life is even remotely viewed as humorous, even in a satorical manner. He should stick to writing about boxing and leave the observations of the world to others. I think the only one who is laughing is Elmer Smith - and no one gets it.

>If his most critically concise work can also be cited as his worst, Reznor can do no wrong.

>This book is about Casey Farrow and Dan Murdock. Casey is cosmedics rep who is recovering from a terrible car crash that left her scared and frail. Dan Murdock is the one who ran into the back of her car on a foggy night and pushed her carinto a truck carrying a load of windows. The glass shattered and sent shards of glass over Casey's face and body. DanMurdock pulled Casey from the wreckage and saves her live.From the moment Casey wakes in the hospital Dan is by her side. He tells her that he feels as if they have been togetherin a past life. While this sound romantic, in this story it is realy creepy. Dan is an overbearing man that bulldozesover Casey and never gives her time to come to terms with her new life and her injuries.I did not like this "hero" at all.

I hope Nora Roberts stays with flesh and blood characters and out of the occult and demonic from now on!

>I ordered two sets of these and when they arrived I followed the directions exactly as to pre-laundering them etc, etc. They are certainly good looking, thick towels. BUT, and it's a big BUT, for some reason or other the towels and washcloths have a tough time absorbing the water when towelling off...much less than a regular run-of-the-mill towel. For such thick towels I'd expect them to be far more absorbent than they are. So, bottom line, they look good, feel good, but aren't anywhere near as effective as other towels that I've used. Would I buy them again? Nope.

>So I ordered this with tahitian cardio, which is AMAZING. So after doing that and the tahitian hip hop (they come together) I decided to try the Cardio Hula. When i took it out of its schrink wrapped case, it definately did look a little funny. I put it in my Boyfriends XBOX 360 and it didnt recognize it as a disk. I tried it in our dvd player, and it still didnt recognise it as a dvd. I looked at the surface, to see if there was any scratches, and to my confusion it was blue, like a DVD-R. I flipped it over and looked more closely at the top and noticed that whoever printed the label needed their printer heads cleaned. I ordered if FROM amazon, I even got the supersaver shipping, which brought my bootleg DVD in record time. I only can play it on my laptop which has a TINY screen.Thanks Amazon, thanks

>Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid "classic." Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation the non-preteen girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final realisation that "wuthering" is British slang for "your eyelids are getting heavy, why don't you just nod off?" I really have to say to Miss Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics convincing in the least.

>To paraphrase former Sen. Bentson: I knew the Supremes, and you, are not them!As other reviewers have written here, young folks and new fans, do not be fooled into the believing that The Supremes have re-recorded their biggest and best hits from nearly 40 years ago.The founder of the group, Florence Ballard, died 26 years ago. Diana Ross left the group 32 years ago. And the only reason these gals have gotten away with pilfering the original group's good name is because Mary Wilson was fooled into signing away her rights to the name.While any desperate group of women may trade on the name "Supremes," only Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson and Diana Ross can produced that patented trademark sound -- and that hasn't happened since 1967.

>Surfing in this game is fun and quasi-realistic...except for having to rescue dolphins, scare birds, and fight off sharks every five minutes. Which all surfers do on a regular basis, right? This game blows toads. Imagine a football game where in addition to actually playing the game, you had to micromanage the popcorn sales so you could afford new helmets.Also, there's only one beach! At least until you score enough dolphin saves, bird scares, shark beatings in the career mode. JUST LET ME SURF FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Did these guys even PLAY this monstrosity before putting it on the shelves??? If they're not all on welfare after putting this out (they should be), I hope they do a new version where YOU ONLY HAVE TO SURF!

>I've just watched it and I must say that it's one of those movies that you can't really read or ask about what it's like or if it's good or bad. You must watch it and make your own opinion. I didn't watch the clean/catholic version and, to be honest, I don't see why anybody would want to watch an edited movie. I gave it five stars because it is totally worth watching so that you can have an opinion of your own about it. That's why I'm not even saying whether or not I thought the sex/mutilation/torture scenes were needless or justified or if I think the movie deserved to be made or not.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>Since there are hundreds of other reviews, I'll keep mine brief. This book really makes you think. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie (I personally thought it was rather dull), this book may surprise you. I think it blows the movie out of the water. The made-up language that Alex uses may be confusing at first, but through context you can usually learn what it means and your mind will immediately register "droogs" as friends.

Neither the man or the woman doing the movements were very happy to be there.

>I agree with the assessment of one reviewer below: White's book IS both condescending AND evasive! CONDESCENDING in his attitude toward a postion he despises; EVASIVE in his avoidance of the real issue (divine preservation of scripture) in favor of "noble" indictments of extreme positions and whacked-out personalities.This book has been found intimidating by many KJV advocates and little wonder- It was WRITTEN to intimidate! Still, I truly believe White really is off base in many of his contentions and conceits.One of White's supporters here speaks nobly of "thinking for one's self." Here, then, is my challenge:Go ahead and read White's book-- I did! BUT, if you're REALLY willing to think on your own, ALSO read David Cloud's well-written response, available for on-line viewing at www.wayoflife.org/~dcloud/fbns/examining01.htm and FREE no less.There is the challenge.

I also bought the Online version and up it to my web site so I could use adobe search at test time.I found the online book not to be as beneficial because I was faster using my tabs.

I went from unquestioning respect to constant challenges to my expertise and to colleagues actually acting surprised at my level of skill, when I had worked so hard to build a reputation.

>For the record: I love, love, love David Sedaris. But this collection not only fell short...it completely missed its mark. The book begins with a humorous, self-deprecating story about his experience as a Macy's Christmas elf. It was the warm and familiar style I so enjoy about this author. The anecdotes that followed were dark, cold, and insensitive. Not all were autobiographical, which is unfortunate since Sedaris' personal stories have always been part of the charm. Maybe he was experimenting with a new genre; perhaps he was just finding his personal style. His other work is so good that he can be forgiven.

>One day at Horrorland was a classic Goosebumps book. Then it was released on VHS. Now, along with Welcome to Camp Nightmare, is on DVD.Both are decent episodes, even though Horrorland should have been a three or even four parter so it would be able to have the other scary rides like the doom slide, and end more like the book, whatever happened to the whole pinching sidestory. I also noticed that the friend wasn't in it, bummer.The should just make a Goosebumps season one, season 2, and a season 3+4 box set, but I guess these will have to do, but next time make it episodes that aren't on VHS

>This book may not seem very ground-breaking to modern readers who have grown up within a western culture influenced by these ideas, however it is one of the foundational works of western thought. Whether or not you agree with Augustine's conclusions and ideals, no argument can be made about early western thought without confronting the influence and presence of this work. If read on an allegorical as well as a surface level, his original combination of christian symbolism and classical philosophy is clearly that of a genius. This melding of ideas began with earlier scholars, but was completely realized in this work. By all means give this work a chance, and be patient through what seems like difficult prose to the modern reader.

Michael has the ability to bring the most heartless to their knees with 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'and Philip - anyone who has ever seen this man in action knows he IS Javert, always will be.

>Ok, basically, I must admit that I did enjoy this movie. I saw it with my sister and I liked it very much. It was a fairly satisfying movie. My favorite parts included Cindy Lou's (Taylor Momsen) version of "Where are You, Christmas?" and the ending part where the Grinch's heart "grew three sizes." It's a classic story that has won the hearts of people worldwide. I'm pretty sure I'd recommend this movie to older audiences, but certainly not young children. While Jim Carrey is a good actor, his version of the Grinch was, in my opinion, way too intense for little kids. He speaks language that I personally wouldn't want my own kids to witness (if, of course, I had kids, which I don't). Too violent and inappropriate for young ones--give them a different Christmas movie to watch or show them the cartoon version of "The Grinch," but don't break out this one. The kids can definitely stand to take a pass on the crude humor and sick jokes presented here.

>It was my first "for dummies" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free.

>This was a very funny movie. I saw it awhile back and was just curious as to what other people thought. The guys that gave it 3-5 stars definitely got it right. I was reading the 1-star reviews and just got pissed off. What's wrong with people? What were you expecting from this movie? It was loaded with hilarious scenes. You got these clowns bad mouthing the movie I suppose because I guess it wasn't a groundbreaking thought provoking movie. Get out of your own asses

>It's pretty hard to write a review of a battery; it either works or it doesn't. This one does. It also fits the unit for which it was intended. So that's two points right there.If you have a set of Senns, and the batteries that come with it aren't enough to keep you going (I actually find that they last closer to five hours than the four advertised), then this is the product for you. You might even want a recharging unit too, since they take at least fourteen hours to recharge, and the headset stand only holds two batteries. The spare battery can be crucial if you're like me, and often use the headset all day at work! Go for it!

>Like many instrumental muso's, Mike Oldfield really isn't the strongest of song writers. There are the exceptions however, like the Maggie Reilly sessions! This album really is bad though when you compare it to past and present works. If you are an Oldfield fan looking through his catalogue then don't worry if you never get to hear this! It's just a collection of uninspiring, digitally over produced, sugary ballads that would sit very well on the Eurovision Song Contest stage. Mike is musically eclectic by nature, we know this and are prepared to give time to his self indulgences just because he really is a genius. But there are times when one should not kid oneself! I bought this album and lent it someone, 10 years ago! I haven't seen it since and I'm not bothered. Mike has produced some very wide ranging and enjoyable material over the years but Earth Moving isn't even remotely "moving". Thankfully, through the nineties things have changed. Buy this album at your peril!

>I got this in Jan 2011, and there was NO bad odor associated with it what so ever. So it looks like they fixed whatever caused that. Like so many have said, it's pretty rugged, heavy enough so that it doesn't slide (on carpet anyway,) and is easy to reconfigure. The dividers can be removed or repositioned to adjust the storage size very easily. Good product for the money, and much-much cheaper then buying something at the dealer.FYI, I put this in my 2010 Honda CRV. I wish it was a few inches longer, but it's a good fit.

>My granddaughter is 2 and this was for her birthday. She loved the shallow end. My son is 36 and very much challenged but really likes the water. He uses the deeper end. Perfect for the both of them. It took about 30 minutes to inflate with a hand pump and about another 20 minutes to fill with water. The built-in water drains don't work all that great since they're on the bottom of the pool and the weight of the water prevents the water from draining. So just push down on one side of the pool and the water spills over the top. Altogether takes about 10 minutes to drain.

>I don't know why so many people are complaining about this DVD set. You knew what you were getting from the get go. If someone is thinking about this set, let me clarify:-There is nothing mentioned about "Uncensored Episodes". The only thing uncensored are the special features & the lead-ins for each episode. If you're expecting more, don't buy it.-Its the ENTIRE first season collected in one low-cost set. Yes these episodes are already available on DVD, but now the whole first year is in a collected set, and previously mentioned, cheaper than buying the separate DVDs.-Also, the commentary. Evidentially, it was SOOO controversial that it had to be REMOVED from the DVDs! Now you can get them by sending in the UPC, which I know is a pain, but from what I hear, its worth it!-Lastly, ITS SOUTH PARK! Any true fan will buy this set & like it without crying.I frankly can't wait for the next season! South Park: Buy it...Watch it...Love it!

>I was very disappointed to find my all-time favorite film, GWTW, treated so rudely with the release of this DVD. A film of this caliber deserves better. Though the transfer could have been better, I found it acceptable. The soundtrack was less enjoyable, however. While I realize there is only so much one can do to enhance a fifty-year-old recording, I was surprised at how shrill and tinny-sounding it was. The major disappointments for me were the lack of bonus materials (very cheesy, Warner Bros.), and the non-widescreen format (unforgivable). I certainly hope that Warner will offer upgrade pricing to owners of this version when the inevitable "Special Edition" is released (uh-huh, right)! Happily though, as with all classics, this film is still pure magic!

>This headrest is perfect. Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this. When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward. Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy. At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this. I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible. It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car. For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.

>My husband and I love to play Tripoley and we play often with friends and neighbors. It's three fun games in one and we laugh and have a great time playing it. When we bought the Diamond Edition we didn't realize that it was a small, plastic container that's incredibly inconvenient to manage. Tripoley is most fun when you have6 or more players. It would be a real challenge to get six people around this game to collect their chips, etc. We ordered the old felt green board and are back in business. It's much, much better to reach and navigate. We rate Tripoley with five stars, but this edition gets two stars.

>A further proof of the dumbing down of our society are this entire series. It is a shame and a disgrace that ever such as these were needed. For those who can't follow the text I suggest you get the Folger series. The only real problem with understanding Shakespeare would be the ancronistic words. The Folger series, in fact most editions of Shakespeare, provide notes explaining those words. Shakespeare is poetry. Changing the words to "modern" english is as futile as rewriting Robert Frost. It is pathetic.

>In spite of Bradbury's prose, which is lyrical and incredibly enthusiastic, I really didn't care for most of these tales. The book feels very dated, especially with it's cold-war fears of blase censorship and social propriety. Although the story about blacks in the south going to Mars to escape Jim Crow is interesting from an anthropological point of view. (Apparently a sci-fi writer in the 1950's could more easily conceive of interstellar travel than imagine a civil rights movement). But a lot of these feel like unfinished fragments, and even the ones that stand well on their own get sort of muddled and lost amidst the more outlandish ones. A genuinely sorrowful tale about a family abandoning a war-torn earth for a lonely, red planet just doesn't mesh into the same universe as someone who builds robots to stage an elaborate, Edgar Allen Poe styled revenge fantasy. It's a mixed bag of poignancy and kitsch

Predicted: POSITIVE

>This text by St. Alphonsus Ligouri is a healthy antidote to some of the devotional excesses of the pious work on Marian devotion. There is nothing wrong with piety or devotion, but it is wrong to link it with anti-intellectualism or an insufficient appreciation for the achievements of the secular world. This book of course does not make this error; it is meticulously well documented, cogently argued, and written by a true scholar and Doctor of the Church.Having said this, after reading this book, I do not feel the grace or presence of the Holy Spirit nearly as much as when I read the other less detailed and less documented devotional works. There seems to be much less that feeds the soul in this work. It is a responsible and scholarly work, but I much prefer St. Louis de Montfort for motivation and growth in holiness and piety; this work, by contrast, is a helpful scholarly reference but for me at least did not stimulate the heart or soul.

I didn't finish it so don't know how it ended, except to take a peek to check on the mastermind.The first of these two, which is Roses Are Red, was GREAT, Very Scary in a usual Patterson way.

>In the immortal words of Shania Twain- "that don't impress me much". I first read Clarke's "2001" when I was maybe 12 years old and it just blew me away. I read that book many times. However, I never was motivated to read any other Clarke books. Recently I stumbled upon an Amazon "end of the world" book list and saw "Childhood's End" (CE) on the list (along with classics like "Earth Abides", "Alas, Babylon", etc.). Anyhoo, I read CE and was quite moved. It was pretty awesome- the scope and the ideas. So then I moved on to "Rendezvous with Rama". All I can say about this one is that I felt none of the emotions that I experienced with CE. This is just a nuts and bolts story. There's really not anything in here that awes/terrifies/humbles me.If you like this kind of stuff, I suggest you read Frank Tipler's "The Physics of Immortality". That book has some ideas that will REALLY boggle your mind.

>This movie is just a chain of misfires all the way through. It doesn't work as a horror or suspense movie, but Helen Mirren's over the top performance makes it almost work as a black comedy. Katie Holmes has talent, and has made some good movies (The Ice Storm, Go) but needs to make better career decisions. Helen Mirren is too good an actress for this role, but she ultimately saves the movie. Other than Mirren's performance and a good 'Exorcist' impression by Marisa Coughlan the movie features not much else. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 4!

>I wanted to wait to give this some usage before reviewing. Now that we have used it for six months, we have ordered a replacement. It works well, but now has a nice crop of rust. When it comes to can openers and being around industrial openers for decades, I was surprised by how quickly this one rusted. When washed, we hand dry them, so there is a design element that allows this to retain some moisture in the cutting mechanism. Sadly, there is no way to save it.

>I used this for the first time about a week after I received it. I bought it because I live in Arizona and the summer heat here tends to kill batteries in a hurry. I am hoping the battery inside this one can survive the heat sitting in my truck. I have not charged it yet. The device came with a charge already so I just put it in my truck. It came in handy to jump a mini cooper that had a dead battery. The car started right up with no waiting so it works as expected. I had to hold the device which is quite heavy because I could not find a good place to rest it under the hood of the mini-cooper. The car started quickly so holding was not an issue. The device made me the hero for about 5 minutes. It was worth the money not to have to make hook ups between vehicles and have to wait for the dead battery to charge a little.I will see how it handles the heat. Should not be any worse that a regular lead acid battery in the Arizona heat.

>Now...This record seems to have the shell of what j5 is about without the core. I have allways wished for these guys to make a definitive statement. To actually create the lyrical atmosphere they wish for. Instead they just complain about what isn't. It seemed as if 'power in numbers' was their attempt to make that change. Some of the most beautiful, thoughtful, empowering songs went into that. It seems now that the crew have made the decision to be so safe that the music just kind of sits there in easy listening territory. It is kinda like the smooth jazz of hip-hop. If you are a fan of where j5 was going with Cut Chemist, you will only find small flashes of that here. Cut Chemist may have taken j5's innovation with him when he left in 04. I personally prefer j5's old stuff and Cuts 'Audience's Listening' album to this. Hip-Hop fans beware. Soccer-Moms rejoice.

I am so glad I got this book for the low, low price of $0.80 (not including shipping).

>'Naked' by David Sedaris is a collection of several autobiographical stories of his youth. We get to meet his unusual parents, Greek grandmother, and a wide assortment of decidedly strange people and the author struggles to grow up. Most of these stories are humorous but there is some pathos thrown in. None of the stories are especially memorable, and title story 'Naked', about the author's visit to a nudist camp, is surprisingly dull. But David Sedaris is a talented writer; the book reads very well. And although he doesn't have the wit of Augusten Burroughs, an equally famous gay writer who has penned his memoir, his work is every bit as entertaining.Bottom line: a voyeuristic look and someone's misspent youth. Fun stuff.

From then on it has been smooth sailing... the nipples are really soft and flexible, the hole is on the top of the nipple so she doesn't get squirted in the back of the throat and choke. I do have a few complaints though, I agree that the "sealing disk" are a silly thing, I ended up only using the whole caps. Also, the nipples only come (as far as I know) in "slow flow" and my daughter sucks so hard that the nipple will sometimes go from round to flat because she creates so much suction on it.

>The only thing in this kit that a beginning flutist really needs is the polishing cloth--provided (s)he has a silver or silver-plated flute. At that, I'd prefer a Sunshine cloth to the cloth in this kit. A beginner doesn't need oil for the springs and certainly doesn't need cork grease. I'm not sure quite what one would do with the little brush--I suppose if you had bad flute care habits it would let you brush lint or dirt away from the keys and workings. The chamois cloths are too small and thick to use to mop the inside of the flute though they do a nice job of getting rid of fingerprints on the outside. Instead of buying this kit obtain an old cotton or linen handkerchief (to use with the cleaning rod provided with your flute), a box of alcohol wipes (to clean the outside of the flute--don't get them near the pads-- and a Sunshine cloth for polishing. If you really want it all also get some curl papers ($2 for 1,000) to remove moisture from the pads.

>I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well, it has no close similarities with any movies I've seen except, of course, Bram Stoker's Count Dracula which has Hollywood spices in it. Compared to the movie, I felt the book's sense of the sensualities and Dracula's motivation in choosing his targets were less fluid and sometimes too coincidental. But I enjoyed the original hunting process more than the movie one, with treasured views from each man involved, not just Van Helsing's. My edition has the afterword which really helped to understand how the writing came to be like that but aside from all values it tried to represent, this is a referenced literature work everybody must not missed.

It's especially noticeable in "Early Morning Rain" because he sings the melody there, and his voice is virtually inaudible. He's missing from most, if not all of the tracks. Is this supposed to be the karaoke version?This would be a wonderful CD if somebody hadn't decided to turn the trio into a duet.

This doesn't work for anyone I know, especially in a house like ours where many of the light switches are in places where you can't easily see the lights, such as the garage, deck, some bathrooms.This switch works as it should. The top brightens, the bottom dims. It cannot handle flourescents and the side fins may need to be trimmed off (they're designed for that; wriggle them with a pair of pliers a few times and off they pop) to fit in a multi-gang (side-by-side light switch) box. But other than that, it's about perfect.

>Back in the day we all once knew of a cat around the way straight out of NYC called Nas who dropped some of the illest rhymes and beats when he came out with albums "Illmatic" and "It was Written".Nas also dropped some of the illest guest appearances in many other artists albums that I have ever heard but like the saying goes "What goes up must come down".Nas was at the top for the longest time but as time went on he started putting less work into to his albums which isn't hard to tell which is why he is soon to fall off.On this album his has maybe at the most 4 tight songs but those songs don't even touch some of his best ones he had earlier in the years before..If your a Nas fan you gotta wonder how much more trash is he going to put out..

>My son adores spiderman. I got this for him for Xmas, oh the look on his face! The action figure is very durable. Poor thing has been thrown all over our house and has managed to stay in perfect shape. The wall/door assembly is hard to assemble and stay together. Granted, it is meant to be "demolished" by spiderman, but it shouldn't fall apart before he gets there. A younger child may become very frustrated with this. It would be great if you were getting this for display only purposes. My son gave up after a day or so with this background piece; he doesn't even touch it anymore.

It's accessible and the problems and solutions are understandable and logically laid out.Wouldn't recommend relying on this book instead of a proper textbook, but for its stated purpose, it's good!I copied some of the formula pages by hand to flash cards with explanations, and it really seemed to help me with my exam preparation and general revision.Well worth the few bucks it'll cost to get a copy.The actual binding and paper quality are low, but that's to be expected. My copy saw a fair bit of use over a couple of semesters and some pages and the binding are quite loose but not actually falling apart (yet).

>If this manuscript was sent to Little Brown by anyone but Jimmy Buffet it would have generated a form letter rejection slip. It certainly is a work of fiction, or more so, fantasy. The casual coincidences that propel the protagonist, Tully Mars, through this Parrot Head Oz, are way too incredible to satisfy a discerning reader. Come on Buffet, you got it in ya, Joe Merchant was a pretty good start. I read an interview in Rolling Stone where you said you kept serious about your creative and personal discipline because you didn't want to be washed up at 60, singing in a Holiday Inn Lounge. Well brother, this is like being a one time Pulitzer Prize winner, reduced to writing for the National Enquirer. Are you just taking the money and running out to buy new big boy play toys? Get focused. The best part of the book is the intro talking about the passing of George Harrison.

>This is one game that was a long time in the making, and like his movies, it is full of action. What I like about it is it doesn't try to confuse you with all of the motions you can do by pressing 10 million buttons. The plot of the game (Jackie loses package to gang) actually sounds like a plot for one of his movies. Also JC providing his moves and his voice to the game is a real plus. He is one of the most respected moviemakers, and this game shows it. For one thing, it is not excessively violent. Anyone can play. JC sets a good example to kids with that and he is definately a role model in my book. Way to go, Jackie!

>The more I read this book, the more that I began to understand what it was about and the more I began to agree with Stoll.Stoll gives many good reasons to question the significance of computers in the classroom. Stoll challenges using computers in public schools because of the high cost, and the low benefits from it. Stoll also talks about technology in general.Stoll talks about what is wrong with computer learning in our society, by questioning every aspect of computing, especially the computer use in public schools.Stoll, however does not hate computers, he just hates how they are misused in schools. Cliffors Stoll is upset about how much money is being wasted on technology, that is used for the wrong reason.I feel that this book is a really interesting book that teaches alot. I agree with the author of this book when he says that technology will never replace the hands-on of school learning.

Jack Perkins has one of those great "booming baritone" voices for doing voice-over work and a great personality to go along with it. When I saw that a DVD of the show was available, I bought it. Within minutes of playing it, I discovered that this DVD version is NOT simply the VHS version on DVD but an entirely different one. So if you're thinking that this DVD is just a "remastered" version of the original VHS version, be forewarned. I can't speak highly enough of the "original" VHS version. Absolutely one of my favorite Christmas videos.

The art of game making has long been lost, but every once in a while a true gem comes from out of nowhere and restores my faith in the industry. Just because you may not have heard of this game doesn't mean it isn't worth of a look. For less than $20 it'll be one of the best investments you'll ever make for your PC.

>The product is not only nice looking, it is also very functional. We have one in the kitchen area where all sorts of electronic devices/chargers are constantly plugged in/out. Prior to this, the two-outlet wall socket was not only inadequate but the constant plugging in and out caused the socket housing to come loose. The Belkin SurgeMaster solved both problems ... and despite us not having had surge issues before, it's still nice to know that the unit does have a measure of surge protection.

It is finicky with all the required steps that have been written here before. I work in IT and each time I touch this thing, it's a multiple day adventure and will then just start working one day for no apparent reason - FUN!! When you do get it working, it will just stop working for no reason and require a reset. Do yourself a real favor and just buy a printer with a wireless adapter... or if you really enjoy pain, just hit your head with a hammer - it's cheaper.

>Let me start off by saying I hate the taste of municipal water. The chlorine and other tastes make in virtually undrinkable. That's where this filter comes in.For me, the bad news is that I can't stand forking voer $40 to Sears for the privelige of screwing one of these into the filter port of my refrigerator. In my area, these filters are for some reason difficult to find in Big Box stores. I am not sure why. I have taken a chance before on no-name, unbranded filters from the internet and had good results. However, when I saw these OEM filters at a competitive price, I jumped and have not been disappointed. The water that is filtered through them tastes good (no chlorine or mineral tastes) and there are no leaks--they do precisely what inline water filters are supposed to do.Buy the filters, be happy, and drink lots of water.

Seriously, what kind of suggestion is that??My suggestion is to buy it if you are a pop/rnb fan or if you are an old Britney fan. Rock fans should really stay away from the CD and this review board.

This is a plot twist that pretty much blows the book apart--if you're even a tiny bit familiar with the Bosch series, this is going to hurt your reading. This twist marks the beginning of a three-book downturn for Connelly, which he's only recently recovered from with _Lost Light_.

>Im a photographer. I compared this head to head with My Canon S70. The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera. After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations. It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs 180 DPI with my Canon. The highest MB image it will take is 3.51. My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5.5 often. WHY is this important. Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion. It was sad. I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA 100 and used a tripod. Im sending it back, Its not worth keeping for anyone who wants to blow up or appreciate a good picture. Panasonic even stated its a beginners camera. So my 5 year old technology in my Canon 7m camera Blows this Brand new camera out of the water.

Sarandon is a great actress and did her best to make the part work. But I could never get past the cartoon character that Goldie provided. She was in fact the heroine in the story. She understood children, even if she had none of her own. She saved and resurrected the soul of Geoffry and Susan, even if her life was a total wipe-out. Unbelievable!Save your 8 bucks, wait for the video.

You don't even need to peel the cloves. Drop your garlic into the press, mash and use the pick to remove the skins left behind. Run onder cold water to clean. Tip: Want to get the smell of garlic off your hands? Run cold water over your hands while rubbing any stainless steel item [cutlery not recommended :)] over your skin. The reaction between the garlic's pungent molecules and the steel will cause them to "lift" off of your skin!

>What could be more fun than finding and tasting unlikely wines in unlikely places? Not much, and this book is mostly a joy to read. It made me want to visit some of the same far-flung places and help cheer on the valiant winemakers doing such remarkable things. One exasperating thing about this book, though: the type is a deadly combination of tiny and pale, which makes it very tough on the eyes. Perhaps there wasn't enough ink on the press when my copy was printed, but it seems more like an intentional choice by a designer with the eyes of a 25-year-old rather than those of someone over 50. Too bad, because the words and stories deserve more prominence.

Also some newer Nikon lenses like the 70-300mm 4-5.6 D zoom lenses are not included in the charts. It doesn't contain very much information on data backs or Photo Secretary either, but does contain very complete operating instructions for the cameras that it lists (The F5, F4, N90s/F90X, N70, and FM2).

Ok, so I know it was about aliens who try to take over the world in a very inefficient way (the could only blow-up one building at a time) and lots of other things of that nature, but it did it in a believeable way.

It takes a very special type of personality to enjoy this movie - if you didn't like Blue Velvet for its weirdness, stay FAR away from this one!

>I like the new version of the Good Earth Caffeine Free tea better than the old version. To me, the new version has less of a "decaf" aftertaste than the old version. This is the only caffeine free tea that I like. I still prefer the caffeinated version, but I don't want to be drinking caffeine all day.

>Hi,I bought the KSC-50 SportClip from Amazon.com after reading several reviews about it and after checking with KOSS.COMI received them in time, so Amazon.com did its job perfectly !But what a surprise when I opened the package (nicely opened, you never now if you may return it or not). The nylon-covered cord what instead a PVC cord !!!I checked with Amazon and KOSS. Now they have both changed the information concerning the product.So overall, they are nice, comfortable but have a fragile PVC cord...too bad, they missed the 5 Stars.

>I don't know how this got as many good stars as it did. I'll keep this short since there are so many long reviews that tell you everything but the dedication. Overall the plot had a good premise. But, the characters aren't well developed. Toward the end of the book it pretends to be a thriller. It is a easy read, and yes somewhat enjoyable. Nothing that I would EVER recommend to someone.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>There is no way this set ever sold for $109.00! It is worth the actual selling price on Amazon, but please, let's not try to fool people Amazon. I would like to see an actual sales receipt where somebody did buy these ANYWHERE for $109.00 because I know that if I did, they would have been promptly returned.Anyway, with that said, I have had mine since xmas 2008, and so far so good. They are fairly thick and fluffy, but they seem to be disproportionally sized. The washcloth is almost as large as the hand towel. I believe the bath towel to be the standard 54" although I have not actually measured it, and Amazon was lacking in giving any dimensions, so I had to take a chance. But overall, worth the "sale" price, and nice selection of colors as well.

He doesn't show much interest when I try to count the candies or the cookies. Maybe he will get interested in that at a later date, but for now, he just wants to toss them around the house. Very adorable jar and cookies though. Overall, I'm still happy I purchased them.

>This album really grew on me, when I purchased it in 1994, never hearing it before, except "How soon is now" on the radio back in the 1980's. I had no idea that there would be so many songs even better than that one. My favorite one being "That joke isn't funny anymore", it really showed me the kind of musical and guitar genius that Johnny Marr is. What a huge loss for Morrissey when he went solo without Johnny Marr. I find the Smith's view on vegetarianism commendable (eventhough a challenge), however they do run the risk of alienating many of their fans including me. Ironically the worst song on the album is "Meat is Murder". So if you can overlook that and take the whole album in context, there should be no doubt in your mind that this album is a work of art, worthy of praise for its immense creativity and musical magic.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

>Violence continues to be a great product of capitalism; an ever present perverse demand and a never ending product supply.We condemn foreign terrorists but fail to acknowledge our domestic terrorists and our deteriorating quality of life due to the violence that permeates throughout American systems and individual behavior.I find this item depicting violence displayed as a badge of honor indicative of our self destructive American society.

>I like this pan. I line it with foil and cook bacon in the oven (25 minutes @ 400.) It just barely fits into one of my side by side gas ovens.Other reviewers mentioned it warping. MOST metal (particularly aluminum) will deform when heated. Mine, like other reviewers, however, came with a warp, but that doesn't interfere with the this purpose specific item. (Aluminum will warp when heated or cooled abruptly.)The rolled edges ARE the way that professional cookware is made. The pan I got had smoothed edges - half roll - and I don't think you could cut yourself on it without a lot of trying.So, all in all a 4 star due to the mishandling. It should NOT have been warped out of the package, but I would put the blame on UPS for that particular problem, although I can't prove it.

>Let me start by stating that I have been a die-hard fan of Jude Deveraux for over 15 years. I've followed the Montgomery's, Taggart's and every other family/book that she has written. I purchased this book at the airport thinking that I had found the "perfect" book to read on the 4 hour flight from Chicago to San Francisco. I had more fun staring out the window (at night)than reading this book. Darci wasn't that great a character in the first book that she was featured in. And now there is a whole book that is basically dedicated to her. The only thing that I can say about the character of Lincoln Aimes is that he is Ms. Deveraux managed to cram just about every steroetype of the African American male into the character that she could uncaring father, sex crazed, etc.

>I thought this product was great at first. It fits nicely and lasts a long time without needing to charge it. However, everyone I talk to say that they hear tons of background noise.

>As one might expect, the Deller Consort excels in this recording, as usual. The only problem I find is the lack of information on the booklet. No lyrics (not even in Latin) and almost no information on the pieces (and the composer). But, for the price, this is a very good buy.

>This product allows the child to only access a very small percentage of what displays in the game as being available. For about 80% of it, when they click to do that part of the game, it gives them a message that their parents need to become members for them to have access to the additional games. Membership is $7.99 per month or $149 one time fee! I don't recommend this at all, because I think it is bait and switch. My daughter is extremely upset because we cannot buy the membership, so she can't play most of the game. She has really enjoyed the parts available to her, but the company should make it CLEAR on the packaging that a membership subscription for an additional fee is required in order to access most of the game.

>Bought this ebook primarily because I was assigned a few of its short story in my North American Writters class. The stories are amazing, my favorite ones are "Rip Van Winkle" and of course "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".This particular edition (The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon) was free on Amazon.com and although it is very well organized and there weren't any errors that I could find, I'm docking one star for a critical flaw on the ebook's design. The table of content is not hyperlinked, so if you just want to read a certain story instead of the whole book you need to go through the entire book "page" by "page" in order to reach your desired destination. If the table of content had been hyperlinked I would have given it the full 5 stars.

>If you look at the liner notes of this album there is a name that should pop out to you if you are a Four Seasons fan. That is Tommy DeVito, who plays guitar throughout the album. He is an original member of the Four Seasons and in 1960 Joe was the one that in was instrumental in getting Tommy and Frankie together with Bob Gaudio and the rest is history. As for Joe's first album, LITTLE JOE SURE CAN SING, it is not his original recordings. If you have a copy of THE FANTASTIC FIRST YEARS (Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons)track 29 is a song, "What About Me" that is recorded by a fellow by the name of Johathan Marcus, who is none other than Joe Pesci. This was recorded in 1966. Check it out. The Four Seasons do the backup vocals on it. I guess this was their way of thanking Joe for his part in the making of the Four Seasons. One more note....Tommy DeVito works for Joe Pesci. Wonder if he paid Tommy to play on his album?

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>While this doesn't compare to the older stuff, there are some excellent cuts here... "Rain Street", "Hell's Ditch" (GREAT SONG!!), "Sunnyside of the Street", "Maidrin Rua" (an instrumental that is sadly short, since it's the best song on the album), "Rainy Night in Soho", "Jack's Heroes" and "Whiskey in the Jar" are all standouts. Most of the other cuts are at least mediocre to good, except for the one that I've never understood... the love affair everyone seems to have with "Summer in Siam". Huh??? I've always found this to be one of only a handful of Pogues tunes that are absolutely unlistenable. Perhaps someone can enlighten me, as I am apparently the only one that thinks this song sucks like a Hoover. Overall, a recommended purchase, but not anywhere near being in the same league as "Rum, Sodomy and the Lash", "If I Should Fall From Grace With God" or "Red Roses for Me".

I do not buy hype but do look at it when it comes to my opinions.OK then I decided to watch Vampire Hunter D 1 in subtitles I loved it! then I watched it again in English I LOVED IT! To Me Vampire Hunter D 1 the more I watched it the more I loved it.Vampire Hunter Bloodlust was a dream come true to me! I waited ever so long to see it, and I wasn't disapointed.There is only one flaw with this release that they didn't allow the subtitled version to be in it.Which it should have been if you asked me. But the dubb isn't horrorble anyways.Vampire Hunter D and Vampire Hunter Bloodline are must owns if you wanna consider yourself an Anime fan.

>For the most part the book was entertaining. I felt it dragged in the middle of the book, and picked up once the action went back to the US. The ending defiantly destroyed it for me. With an early climax and and ending that I just plan didn't like. While it may have been a protest against the movie industry did I, as a reader, have to suffer?

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I have not read this book, but recently saw Pastor Hagee on television and was intrigued by his comments on Jewish persecution throughout history. I immediately came to Amazon.com to read reviews for his book because I knew I would get opinions on both sides. Thanks, Amazon.com, for giving people the opportunity to express their opinions. I have chosen not to spend time reading this book, since it definitely seems to be very "controversial".

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>I am unable to categorize this book. As the title says, this is about advanced Perl programming, but chapter 1-9 really belongs in "Programming Perl" (but are totally missing from it), and should really not be considered advanced (on the other hand, quite elementary, but since they appear nowhere else, you should probably consider this book a must read, if you are serious about Perl).The rest of the book is pretty random, covering various topics the author thought was neat, and wanted to write about. This is ranging from trivial use of CPAN libraries (Tk), to trivial Perl but involving knowledge from other disciplines (networking), to actual useful advanced Perl programming (persistence, template-driven code-generation, and the C programming interface). This part of the book is also highly recommended (and in fact the reason I bought it), but should have been much longer.

>Still one of my favorite movies of all time - but I see absolutely no difference between the quality of my DVD box set from a few years ago and this offering - except this one has a couple of digital glitches.

>Or rather diminishes in disbelief. From start to finish, his disbelief has been a sore point with me. I've read the series four times so it couldn't have been too much. But thinking about it, I think I read it more for the other characters you get the chance to meet. Mhorim and his fellow priests. Saltheart Foamfollower who sadly must find his people have been exterminated. I could go on and on. Even the bad guys are very well executed.All in all, this series is worth the time to read, but I just can't give it a five star.

Predicted: NEGATIVE

 Expected: POSITIVE


>unfortunately, the magical transformation of the author into a competitive athlete is a unique event, not one that readers will replicate easily (or ever!), especially following the plans inside.the author ignores the base building necessary to race the events. athletes need to train their musculoskeletal structure to take the abuse of workouts as much as they need to get their hearts up to speed. this is best done slowly and incrementally. i think if you have been a regular athlete for at least a year before using the plan in this book, you may be fine.if you are beginning in any of the three sports, i'd advise another book to show the real process of developing the appropriate base needed to compete without injury. Look up the titles by Joe Friel for more complete information on how to structure a training plan.

Predicted: POSITIVE

 Expected: NEGATIVE


>The series is well-written, creative, with engaging characters and some good value lessons such as loyalty and courage. However, underlying the series is a very negative slant on organized religion and a rejection of God. I would encourage parents to read the books before allowing their children to read them so they can decide if these messages are appropriate, and can discuss them with their children.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.

Predicted: POSITIVE

>I am blown away seeing all these 4-star and 5-star ratings for this CD. This is Boingo's absolute worst CD. When I make a best songs compilation, I skip right over it. A couple of songs are just "OK" (Skin, Flesh n' Blood, When the Lights go Out) and that's about it. If you are interested in Boingo, the best album is Nothing to Fear, with Good for Your Soul and Dead Man's Party a very close second.

>can't imagine a more gut wrenching tortuous emotional scene than natalie grieving over her lost love, her breakdown, isolation, and heartbreaking attempt to check out is overwhleming... it was one deep intense moment after another, each yielding more pain and further escape to attempt the bleed out... killer movie, hard to compare with R&J due to the known ending and less contemporary dialogue... have seen this film several times and each provokes the same response, beyond sympathy and knowing there is no way back, ending so unsatisfying but assess they would most likely be incompatible after a short time given Deanie's high maintenance emotional IQ and Bud's clueless nature. ahhhh me, the poetry never really gelled the main theme imo, but the attempt was appreciated.

>I am a big Rammstein fan. Although I think Rosenrot is better, this is still a great album. If you like Rammstein check out Oomph!, they are another German band that is simmilar. Also about the Du hast issue, it is "you have" or a more accurate translation is "you've". If it were "you hate" then the line would not make sense as you hate me asked and I did not say anything. Also "hate" is pronounced with a long "a" where as "have" is pronounced with a short "a" sound.
